  <sect1 xml:id="tools-synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title>

    <para>This chapter is an introduction to using some of the
      programming tools supplied with FreeBSD, although much of it
      will be applicable to many other versions of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>.  It does
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> attempt to describe coding in any
      detail.  Most of the chapter assumes little or no previous
      programming knowledge, although it is hoped that most
      programmers will find something of value in it.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="tools-intro"><title>Introduction</title>

    <para>FreeBSD offers an excellent development environment.
      Compilers for C and C++ and an assembler come with the
      basic system, not to mention classic <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>
      tools such as <command>sed</command> and <command>awk</command>.
      If that is not enough, there are many more compilers and
      interpreters in the Ports collection.  The following section,
      <link linkend="tools-programming">Introduction to Programming</link>,
      lists some of the available options.  FreeBSD is very
      compatible with standards such as <acronym><trademark class="registered">POSIX</trademark></acronym> and
      <acronym>ANSI</acronym> C, as well with its own BSD heritage, so
      it is possible to write applications that will compile and run
      with little or no modification on a wide range of
      platforms.</para>

    <para>However, all this power can be rather overwhelming at first
      if you have never written programs on a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> platform before.
      This document aims to help you get up and running, without
      getting too deeply into more advanced topics.  The intention is
      that this document should give you enough of the basics to be
      able to make some sense of the documentation.</para>

    <para>Most of the document requires little or no knowledge of
      programming, although it does assume a basic competence with
      using <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> and a willingness to learn!</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="tools-programming">
    <title>Introduction to Programming</title>

    <para>A program is a set of instructions that tell the computer to
      do various things; sometimes the instruction it has to perform
      depends on what happened when it performed a previous
      instruction.  This section gives an overview of the two main
      ways in which you can give these instructions, or
      <quote>commands</quote> as they are usually called.  One way
      uses an <firstterm>interpreter</firstterm>, the other a
      <firstterm>compiler</firstterm>.  As human languages are too
      difficult for a computer to understand in an unambiguous way,
      commands are usually written in one or other languages specially
      designed for the purpose.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Interpreters</title>

      <para>With an interpreter, the language comes as an environment,
	where you type in commands at a prompt and the environment
	executes them for you.  For more complicated programs, you can
	type the commands into a file and get the interpreter to load
	the file and execute the commands in it.  If anything goes
	wrong, many interpreters will drop you into a debugger to help
	you track down the problem.</para>

      <para>The advantage of this is that you can see the results of
	your commands immediately, and mistakes can be corrected
	readily.  The biggest disadvantage comes when you want to
	share your programs with someone.  They must have the same
	interpreter, or you must have some way of giving it to them,
	and they need to understand how to use it.  Also users may not
	appreciate being thrown into a debugger if they press the
	wrong key! From a performance point of view, interpreters can
	use up a lot of memory, and generally do not generate code as
	efficiently as compilers.</para>

      <para>In my opinion, interpreted languages are the best way to
	start if you have not done any programming before.  This kind
	of environment is typically found with languages like Lisp,
	Smalltalk, Perl and Basic.  It could also be argued that the
	<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> shell (<command>sh</command>, <command>csh</command>) is itself an
	interpreter, and many people do in fact write shell
	<quote>scripts</quote> to help with various
	<quote>housekeeping</quote> tasks on their machine.  Indeed, part
	of the original <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> philosophy was to provide lots of small
	utility programs that could be linked together in shell
	scripts to perform useful tasks.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Interpreters available with FreeBSD</title>

      <para>Here is a list of interpreters that are available from
	  the FreeBSD Ports Collection, with a brief discussion of
	  some of the more popular interpreted languages.</para>

      <para>Instructions on how to get and install applications
	from the Ports Collection can be found in the
	<link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html">
      Ports section</link> of the handbook.</para>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><acronym>BASIC</acronym></term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Short for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic
	      Instruction Code.  Developed in the 1950s for teaching
	      University students to program and provided with every
	      self-respecting personal computer in the 1980s,
	      <acronym>BASIC</acronym> has been the first programming
	      language for many programmers.  It is also the foundation
	      for Visual Basic.</para>

	    <para>The Bywater Basic Interpreter can be found in the
	      Ports Collection as
	      <package>lang/bwbasic</package>
	      and the Phil Cockroft's Basic Interpreter
	      (formerly Rabbit Basic) is available as
	      <package>lang/pbasic</package>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Lisp</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>A language that was developed in the late 1950s as
	      an alternative to the <quote>number-crunching</quote>
	      languages that were popular at the time.  Instead of
	      being based on numbers, Lisp is based on lists; in fact
	      the name is short for <quote>List Processing</quote>.
	      Very popular in <acronym>AI</acronym> (Artificial Intelligence)
	      circles.</para>

	    <para>Lisp is an extremely powerful and sophisticated
	      language, but can be rather large and unwieldy.</para>

	    <para>Various implementations of Lisp that can run on <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>
	      systems are available in the Ports Collection for FreeBSD.
	      GNU Common Lisp can be found as
	      <package>lang/gcl</package>.  CLISP
	      by Bruno Haible and Michael Stoll is available as
	      <package>lang/clisp</package>.
	      For CMUCL, which includes a highly-optimizing compiler too, or
	      simpler Lisp implementations like SLisp, which implements most
	      of the Common Lisp constructs in a few hundred lines of C code,
	      <package>lang/cmucl</package> and
	      <package>lang/slisp</package> are available
	      respectively.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Perl</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Very popular with system administrators for writing
	      scripts; also often used on World Wide Web servers for
	      writing <acronym>CGI</acronym> scripts.</para>

	    <para>Perl is available in the Ports Collection as
	      <package>lang/perl5.16</package> for all
	      FreeBSD releases.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Scheme</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>A dialect of Lisp that is rather more compact and
	      cleaner than Common Lisp.  Popular in Universities as it

      <title>Compilers</title>

      <para>Compilers are rather different.  First of all, you write
	your code in a file (or files) using an editor.  You then run
	the compiler and see if it accepts your program.  If it did
	not compile, grit your teeth and go back to the editor; if it
	did compile and gave you a program, you can run it either at a
	shell command prompt or in a debugger to see if it works
	properly.

	<footnote>
	  <para>If you run it in the shell, you may get a core
	    dump.</para>
	</footnote></para>

      <para>Obviously, this is not quite as direct as using an
	interpreter.  However it allows you to do a lot of things
	which are very difficult or even impossible with an
	interpreter, such as writing code which interacts closely with
	the operating system&#8212;or even writing your own operating
	system! It is also useful if you need to write very efficient
	code, as the compiler can take its time and optimize the code,
	which would not be acceptable in an interpreter.  Moreover,
	distributing a program written for a compiler is usually more
	straightforward than one written for an interpreter&#8212;you
	can just give them a copy of the executable, assuming they
	have the same operating system as you.</para>

      <para>As the edit-compile-run-debug cycle is rather tedious when
	using separate programs, many commercial compiler makers have
	produced Integrated Development Environments
	(<acronym>IDE</acronym>s for short).  FreeBSD does not include
	an IDE in the base system, but <package>devel/kdevelop</package> is
	available in the Ports Collection and many use
	<application>Emacs</application> for this purpose.  Using
	<application>Emacs</application> as an IDE is discussed in
	<xref linkend="emacs"/>.</para>

    <title>Compiling with <command>cc</command></title>

    <para>This section deals with the <application>gcc</application>
      and <application>clang</application> compilers for C and C++,
      since they come with the FreeBSD base system.  Starting with
      FreeBSD 10.X <command>clang</command> is installed as
      <command>cc</command>.  The
      details of producing a program with an interpreter vary
      considerably between interpreters, and are usually well covered
      in the documentation and on-line help for the
      interpreter.</para>

    <para>Once you have written your masterpiece, the next step is to
      convert it into something that will (hopefully!) run on FreeBSD.
      This usually involves several steps, each of which is done by a
      separate program.</para>

    <procedure>

    <para>Fortunately, almost all this detail is hidden from you, as

    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cc foo.c bar.c</userinput></screen>

    <para>Note that the syntax checking is just that&#8212;checking
      the syntax.  It will not check for any logical mistakes you may

	    <para>The name <firstterm>core dump</firstterm> dates back
	      to the very early days of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>, when the machines used
	      core memory for storing data.  Basically, if the program
	      failed under certain conditions, the system would write
	      the contents of core memory to disk in a file called
	      <filename>core</filename>, which the programmer could
	      then pore over to find out what went wrong.</para>

	  <question>
	    <para>When my program dumped core, it said something about
	      a <errorname>segmentation fault</errorname>.  What is
	      that?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>This basically means that your program tried to
	      perform some sort of illegal operation on memory; <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>
	      is designed to protect the operating system and other
	      programs from rogue programs.</para>

	    <para>Common causes for this are:</para>

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>Trying to write to a <symbol>NULL</symbol>
		  pointer, eg</para>

		<programlisting>char *foo = NULL;
strcpy(foo, "bang!");
		</programlisting>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Using a pointer that has not been initialized,
		  eg</para>

		<programlisting>char *foo;
strcpy(foo, "bang!");
		</programlisting>

		<para>The pointer will have some random value that,
		  with luck, will point into an area of memory that
		  is not available to your program and the kernel will
		  kill your program before it can do any damage.  If
		  you are unlucky, it will point somewhere inside your
		  own program and corrupt one of your data structures,
		  causing the program to fail mysteriously.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Trying to access past the end of an array,
		  eg</para>

		<programlisting>int bar[20];
bar[27] = 6;
		</programlisting>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Trying to store something in read-only memory,
		  eg</para>

		<programlisting>char *foo = "My string";
strcpy(foo, "bang!");
		</programlisting>

		<para><trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> compilers often put string literals like
		  <literal>"My string"</literal> into read-only areas
		  of memory.</para>
	      </listitem>

	      <listitem>
		<para>Doing naughty things with
		  <function>malloc()</function> and
		  <function>free()</function>, eg</para>

		<programlisting>char bar[80];
free(bar);
		</programlisting>

		<para>or</para>

		<programlisting>char *foo = malloc(27);
free(foo);
free(foo);
		</programlisting>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>

	    <para>Making one of these mistakes will not always lead to
	      an error, but they are always bad practice.  Some
	      systems and compilers are more tolerant than others,
	      which is why programs that ran well on one system can
	      crash when you try them on an another.</para>

	  <question>
	    <para>Sometimes when I get a core dump it says
	      <errorname>bus error</errorname>.  It says in my <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>
	      book that this means a hardware problem, but the
	      computer still seems to be working.  Is this
	      true?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>No, fortunately not (unless of course you really do
	      have a hardware problem&#8230;).  This is usually
	      another way of saying that you accessed memory in a way
	      you should not have.</para>

	  <question>
	    <para>This dumping core business sounds as though it could
	      be quite useful, if I can make it happen when I want to.
	      Can I do this, or do I have to wait until there is an
	      error?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>Yes, just go to another console or xterm, do</para>

	    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>ps</userinput>
	    </screen>

	    <para>to find out the process ID of your program, and
	      do</para>

	    <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>kill -ABRT <replaceable>pid</replaceable></userinput>
	    </screen>

	    <para>where
	      <parameter><replaceable>pid</replaceable></parameter> is
	      the process ID you looked up.</para>

	    <para>This is useful if your program has got stuck in an
	      infinite loop, for instance.  If your program happens to
	      trap <symbol>SIGABRT</symbol>, there are several other
	      signals which have a similar effect.</para>

	    <para>Alternatively, you can create a core dump from
	      inside your program, by calling the
	      <function>abort()</function> function. See the manual page
	      of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>abort</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> to learn more.</para>

            <para>If you want to create a core dump from outside your
              program, but do not want the process to terminate, you
              can use the <command>gcore</command> program. See the
              manual page of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gcore</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> for more information.</para>

      <title>What is <command>make</command>?</title>

      <para>When you are working on a simple program with only one or
	two source files, typing in</para>

      <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cc file1.c file2.c</userinput></screen>

      <para>is not too bad, but it quickly becomes very tedious when
	there are several files&#8212;and it can take a while to
	compile, too.</para>

      <para>One way to get around this is to use object files and only
	recompile the source file if the source code has changed.  So
	we could have something like:</para>

      <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cc file1.o file2.o</userinput> &#8230; <userinput>file37.c</userinput> &#8230;</screen>

      <para>if we had changed <filename>file37.c</filename>, but not any
	of the others, since the last time we compiled.  This may
	speed up the compilation quite a bit, but does not solve the
	typing problem.</para>

      <para>Or we could write a shell script to solve the typing
	problem, but it would have to re-compile everything, making it
	very inefficient on a large project.</para>

      <para>What happens if we have hundreds of source files lying
	about? What if we are working in a team with other people who
	forget to tell us when they have changed one of their source
	files that we use?</para>

      <para>Perhaps we could put the two solutions together and write
	something like a shell script that would contain some kind of
	magic rule saying when a source file needs compiling.  Now all
	we need now is a program that can understand these rules, as
	it is a bit too complicated for the shell.</para>

      <para>This program is called <command>make</command>.  It reads
	in a file, called a <firstterm>makefile</firstterm>, that
	tells it how different files depend on each other, and works
	out which files need to be re-compiled and which ones do not.
	For example, a rule could say something like <quote>if
	  <filename>fromboz.o</filename> is older than
	  <filename>fromboz.c</filename>, that means someone must have
	  changed <filename>fromboz.c</filename>, so it needs to be
	  re-compiled.</quote> The makefile also has rules telling
	make <emphasis>how</emphasis> to re-compile the source file,
	making it a much more powerful tool.</para>

      <para>Makefiles are typically kept in the same directory as the
	source they apply to, and can be called
	<filename>makefile</filename>, <filename>Makefile</filename>
	or <filename>MAKEFILE</filename>.  Most programmers use the
	name <filename>Makefile</filename>, as this puts it near the
	top of a directory listing, where it can easily be
	seen.

	<footnote>
	  <para>They do not use the <filename>MAKEFILE</filename> form
	    as block capitals are often used for documentation files
	    like <filename>README</filename>.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Example of using <command>make</command></title>

      <para>Here is a very simple make file:</para>

      <programlisting>foo: foo.c
	cc -o foo foo.c</programlisting>

      <para>It consists of two lines, a dependency line and a creation
	line.</para>

      <para>The dependency line here consists of the name of the
	program (known as the <firstterm>target</firstterm>), followed
	by a colon, then whitespace, then the name of the source file.
	When <command>make</command> reads this line, it looks to see
	if <filename>foo</filename> exists; if it exists, it compares
	the time <filename>foo</filename> was last modified to the
	time <filename>foo.c</filename> was last modified.  If
	<filename>foo</filename> does not exist, or is older than
	<filename>foo.c</filename>, it then looks at the creation line
	to find out what to do.  In other words, this is the rule for
	working out when <filename>foo.c</filename> needs to be
	re-compiled.</para>

      <para>The creation line starts with a <token>tab</token> (press
	the <keycap>tab</keycap> key) and then the command you would
	type to create <filename>foo</filename> if you were doing it
	at a command prompt.  If <filename>foo</filename> is out of
	date, or does not exist, <command>make</command> then executes
	this command to create it.  In other words, this is the rule
	which tells make how to re-compile
	<filename>foo.c</filename>.</para>

      <para>So, when you type <userinput>make</userinput>, it will
	make sure that <filename>foo</filename> is up to date with
	respect to your latest changes to <filename>foo.c</filename>.
	This principle can be extended to
	<filename>Makefile</filename>s with hundreds of
	targets&#8212;in fact, on FreeBSD, it is possible to compile
	the entire operating system just by typing <userinput>make
	  world</userinput> in the appropriate directory!</para>

      <para>Another useful property of makefiles is that the targets
	do not have to be programs.  For instance, we could have a make
	file that looks like this:</para>

      <programlisting>foo: foo.c
	cc -o foo foo.c

install:
	cp foo /home/me</programlisting>

      <para>We can tell make which target we want to make by
	typing:</para>

      <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make <replaceable>target</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para><command>make</command> will then only look at that target
	and ignore any others.  For example, if we type
	<userinput>make foo</userinput> with the makefile above, make
	will ignore the <buildtarget>install</buildtarget> target.</para>

      <para>If we just type <userinput>make</userinput> on its own,
	make will always look at the first target and then stop
	without looking at any others.  So if we typed
	<userinput>make</userinput> here, it will just go to the
	<buildtarget>foo</buildtarget> target, re-compile
	<filename>foo</filename> if necessary, and then stop without
	going on to the <buildtarget>install</buildtarget> target.</para>

      <para>Notice that the <buildtarget>install</buildtarget> target does not
	actually depend on anything! This means that the command on
	the following line is always executed when we try to make that
	target by typing <userinput>make install</userinput>.  In this
	case, it will copy <filename>foo</filename> into the user's
	home directory.  This is often used by application makefiles,
	so that the application can be installed in the correct
	directory when it has been correctly compiled.</para>

      <para>This is a slightly confusing subject to try to explain.
	If you do not quite understand how <command>make</command>
	works, the best thing to do is to write a simple program like
	<quote>hello world</quote> and a make file like the one above
	and experiment.  Then progress to using more than one source
	file, or having the source file include a header file.  The
	<command>touch</command> command is very useful here&#8212;it
	changes the date on a file without you having to edit
	it.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Make and include-files</title>

      <para>C code often starts with a list of files to include, for
	example stdio.h. Some of these files are system-include
	files, some of them are from the project you are now working
	on:
      </para>

      <programlisting>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "foo.h"

int main(....</programlisting>

      <para>To make sure that this file is recompiled the moment
        <filename>foo.h</filename> is changed, you have to add it in
        your <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>foo: foo.c foo.h</programlisting>

      <para>The moment your project is getting bigger and you have
	more and more own include-files to maintain, it will be a
	pain to keep track of all include files and the files which
	are depending on it. If you change an include-file but
	forget to recompile all the files which are depending on
	it, the results will be devastating. <command>clang</command>
	has an option to analyze your files and to produce a list
	of include-files and their dependencies: <option>-MM</option>.
      </para>

      <para>If you add this to your Makefile:</para>

      <programlisting>depend:
	cc -E -MM *.c &gt; .depend</programlisting>

      <para>and run <userinput>make depend</userinput>, the file
	<filename>.depend</filename> will appear with a list of
	object-files, C-files and the include-files:</para>

      <programlisting>foo.o: foo.c foo.h</programlisting>

      <para>If you change <filename>foo.h</filename>, next time
	you run <command>make</command> all files depending on
	<filename>foo.h</filename> will be recompiled.</para>

      <para>Do not forget to run <command>make depend</command> each
        time you add an include-file to one of your files.</para>

      <title>FreeBSD Makefiles</title>

      <para>Makefiles can be rather complicated to write.  Fortunately,
	BSD-based systems like FreeBSD come with some very powerful
	ones as part of the system.  One very good example of this is
	the FreeBSD ports system.  Here is the essential part of a
	typical ports <filename>Makefile</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>MASTER_SITES=   ftp://freefall.cdrom.com/pub/FreeBSD/LOCAL_PORTS/
DISTFILES=      scheme-microcode+dist-7.3-freebsd.tgz

.include &lt;bsd.port.mk&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Now, if we go to the directory for this port and type
	<userinput>make</userinput>, the following happens:</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <para>A check is made to see if the source code for this
	    port is already on the system.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>If it is not, an FTP connection to the URL in
	    <symbol>MASTER_SITES</symbol> is set up to download the
	    source.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The checksum for the source is calculated and compared
	    it with one for a known, good, copy of the source.  This
	    is to make sure that the source was not corrupted while in
	    transit.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Any changes required to make the source work on
	    FreeBSD are applied&#8212;this is known as
	    <firstterm>patching</firstterm>.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>Any special configuration needed for the source is
	    done.  (Many <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> program distributions try to work out
	    which version of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> they are being compiled on and which
	    optional <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> features are present&#8212;this is where
	    they are given the information in the FreeBSD ports
	    scenario).</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>The source code for the program is compiled.  In
	    effect, we change to the directory where the source was
	    unpacked and do <command>make</command>&#8212;the
	    program's own make file has the necessary information to
	    build the program.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <para>We now have a compiled version of the program.  If we
	    wish, we can test it now; when we feel confident about the
	    program, we can type <userinput>make install</userinput>.
	    This will cause the program and any supporting files it
	    needs to be copied into the correct location; an entry is
	    also made into a <database>package database</database>, so
	    that the port can easily be uninstalled later if we change
	    our mind about it.</para>
	</step>
      </procedure>

      <para>Now I think you will agree that is rather impressive for a
	four line script!</para>

      <para>The secret lies in the last line, which tells
	<command>make</command> to look in the system makefile called
	<filename>bsd.port.mk</filename>.  It is easy to overlook this
	line, but this is where all the clever stuff comes
	from&#8212;someone has written a makefile that tells
	<command>make</command> to do all the things above (plus a
	couple of other things I did not mention, including handling
	any errors that may occur) and anyone can get access to that
	just by putting a single line in their own make file!</para>

      <para>If you want to have a look at these system makefiles,
	they are in <filename>/usr/share/mk</filename>, but it is
	probably best to wait until you have had a bit of practice with
	makefiles, as they are very complicated (and if you do look at
	them, make sure you have a flask of strong coffee
	handy!)</para>

      <title>More advanced uses of <command>make</command></title>

      <para><command>Make</command> is a very powerful tool, and can
	do much more than the simple example above shows.
	Unfortunately, there are several different versions of
	<command>make</command>, and they all differ considerably.
	The best way to learn what they can do is probably to read the
	documentation&#8212;hopefully this introduction will have
	given you a base from which you can do this.</para>

      <para>The version of make that comes with FreeBSD is the
	<application>Berkeley make</application>; there is a tutorial
	for it in <filename>/usr/share/doc/psd/12.make</filename>.  To
	view it, do</para>

      <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>zmore paper.ascii.gz</userinput></screen>

      <para>in that directory.</para>

      <para>Many applications in the ports use <application>GNU
	  make</application>, which has a very good set of
	<quote>info</quote> pages.  If you have installed any of these
	ports, <application>GNU make</application> will automatically
	have been installed as <command>gmake</command>.  It is also
	available as a port and package in its own right.</para>

      <para>To view the info pages for <application>GNU
	make</application>, you will have to edit the
	<filename>dir</filename> file in the

      <programlisting> * Make: (make).                 The GNU Make utility.</programlisting>

      <para>to the file.  Once you have done this, you can type
	<userinput>info</userinput> and then select
	<guimenuitem>make</guimenuitem> from the menu (or in

      <title>The Debugger</title>

      <para>The debugger that comes with FreeBSD is called
	<command>gdb</command> (<application>GNU
	  debugger</application>).  You start it up by typing</para>

      <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>gdb <replaceable>progname</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>although many people prefer to run it inside
	<application>Emacs</application>.  You can do this by:</para>

      <screen><userinput>M-x gdb RET <replaceable>progname</replaceable> RET</userinput></screen>

      <para>Using a debugger allows you to run the program under more
	controlled circumstances.  Typically, you can step through the
	program a line at a time, inspect the value of variables,
	change them, tell the debugger to run up to a certain point
	and then stop, and so on.  You can even attach to a program
	that is already running, or load a core file to investigate why
	the program crashed.  It is even possible to debug the kernel,
	though that is a little trickier than the user applications
	we will be discussing in this section.</para>

      <para><command>gdb</command> has quite good on-line help, as

      <title>Running a program in the debugger</title>

      <para>You will need to have compiled the program with the
	<option>-g</option> option to get the most out of using
	<command>gdb</command>.  It will work without, but you will only
	see the name of the function you are in, instead of the source
	code.  If you see a line like:</para>

      <screen>&#8230; (no debugging symbols found) &#8230;</screen>

      <para>when <command>gdb</command> starts up, you will know that
	the program was not compiled with the <option>-g</option>
	option.</para>

      <para>At the <command>gdb</command> prompt, type
	<userinput>break main</userinput>.  This will tell the
	debugger that you are not interested in watching the
	preliminary set-up code in the program being run, and that it
	should stop execution at the beginning of your code.  Now type
	<userinput>run</userinput> to start the program&#8212;it will
	start at the beginning of the set-up code and then get stopped
	by the debugger when it calls <function>main()</function>.
	(If you have ever wondered where <function>main()</function>
	gets called from, now you know!).</para>

      <para>You can now step through the program, a line at a time, by
	pressing <command>n</command>.  If you get to a function call,
	you can step into it by pressing <command>s</command>.  Once
	you are in a function call, you can return from stepping into a
	function call by pressing <command>f</command>.  You can also
	use <command>up</command> and <command>down</command> to take
	a quick look at the caller.</para>

      <para>Here is a simple example of how to spot a mistake in a
	program with <command>gdb</command>.  This is our program
	(with a deliberate mistake):</para>

int bazz(int anint);

main() {
	int i;

	printf("This is my program\n");
	bazz(i);

}

      <title>Examining a core file</title>

      <para>A core file is basically a file which contains the
	complete state of the process when it crashed.  In <quote>the
	  good old days</quote>, programmers had to print out hex
	listings of core files and sweat over machine code manuals,
	but now life is a bit easier.  Incidentally, under FreeBSD and
	other 4.4BSD systems, a core file is called
	<filename><replaceable>progname</replaceable>.core</filename> instead of just
	<filename>core</filename>, to make it clearer which program a
	core file belongs to.</para>

      <para>To examine a core file, start up <command>gdb</command> in
	the usual way.  Instead of typing <command>break</command> or
	<command>run</command>, type</para>

      <screen>(gdb) <userinput>core <replaceable>progname</replaceable>.core</userinput></screen>

      <para>If you are not in the same directory as the core file,
	you will have to do <userinput>dir
	  /path/to/core/file</userinput> first.</para>

      <para>You should see something like this:</para>

      <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>gdb a.out</userinput>

      <para>In this case, the program was called
	<filename>a.out</filename>, so the core file is called
	<filename>a.out.core</filename>.  We can see that the program
	crashed due to trying to access an area in memory that was not
	available to it in a function called
	<function>bazz</function>.</para>

      <para>Sometimes it is useful to be able to see how a function was
	called, as the problem could have occurred a long way up the

      <title>Attaching to a running program</title>

      <para>One of the neatest features about <command>gdb</command>
	is that it can attach to a program that is already running.  Of
	course, that assumes you have sufficient permissions to do so.
	A common problem is when you are stepping through a program
	that forks, and you want to trace the child, but the debugger
	will only let you trace the parent.</para>

      <para>What you do is start up another <command>gdb</command>,
	use <command>ps</command> to find the process ID for the
	child, and do</para>

      <screen>(gdb) <userinput>attach <replaceable>pid</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>in <command>gdb</command>, and then debug as usual.</para>

      <para><quote>That is all very well,</quote> you are probably
	thinking, <quote>but by the time I have done that, the child
	  process will be over the hill and far away</quote>.  Fear
	not, gentle reader, here is how to do it (courtesy of the
	<command>gdb</command> info pages):</para>

      <screen><lineannotation>&#8230;</lineannotation>
if ((pid = fork()) &lt; 0)		/* _Always_ check this */
	error();
else if (pid == 0) {		/* child */
	int PauseMode = 1;

	while (PauseMode)
		sleep(10);	/* Wait until someone attaches to us */
	<lineannotation>&#8230;</lineannotation>
} else {			/* parent */
	<lineannotation>&#8230;</lineannotation></screen>

      <para>Now all you have to do is attach to the child, set
	<symbol>PauseMode</symbol> to <literal>0</literal>, and wait
	for the <function>sleep()</function> call to return!</para>

    <title>Using Emacs as a Development Environment</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Emacs</title>

      <para>Emacs is a highly customizable
	editor&#8212;indeed, it has been customized to the point where
	it is more like an operating system than an editor! Many
	developers and sysadmins do in fact spend practically all
	their time working inside Emacs, leaving it only to log
	out.</para>

      <para>It is impossible even to summarize everything Emacs can do
	here, but here are some of the features of interest to
	developers:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Very powerful editor, allowing search-and-replace on
	    both strings and regular expressions (patterns), jumping
	    to start/end of block expression, etc, etc.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Pull-down menus and online help.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Language-dependent syntax highlighting and
	    indentation.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Completely customizable.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>You can compile and debug programs within
	    Emacs.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>On a compilation error, you can jump to the offending
	    line of source code.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Friendly-ish front-end to the <command>info</command>
	    program used for reading GNU hypertext documentation,
	    including the documentation on Emacs itself.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Friendly front-end to <command>gdb</command>, allowing
	    you to look at the source code as you step through your
	    program.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>And doubtless many more that have been overlooked.</para>

      <para>Emacs can be installed on FreeBSD using
	the <package>editors/emacs</package>
	port.</para>

      <para>Once it is installed, start it up and do <userinput>C-h
	  t</userinput> to read an Emacs tutorial&#8212;that means
	hold down the <keycap>control</keycap> key, press
	<keycap>h</keycap>, let go of the <keycap>control</keycap>
	key, and then press <keycap>t</keycap>.  (Alternatively, you
	can use the mouse to select <guimenuitem>Emacs
	  Tutorial</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Help</guimenu>
	menu.)</para>

      <para>Although Emacs does have menus, it is well worth learning
	the key bindings, as it is much quicker when you are editing
	something to press a couple of keys than to try to find the
	mouse and then click on the right place.  And, when you are
	talking to seasoned Emacs users, you will find they often
	casually throw around expressions like <quote><literal>M-x
	    replace-s RET foo RET bar RET</literal></quote> so it is
	useful to know what they mean.  And in any case, Emacs has far
	too many useful functions for them to all fit on the menu
	bars.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, it is quite easy to pick up the key-bindings,
	as they are displayed next to the menu item.  My advice is to
	use the menu item for, say, opening a file until you
	understand how it works and feel confident with it, then try
	doing C-x C-f.  When you are happy with that, move on to
	another menu command.</para>

      <para>If you can not remember what a particular combination of
	keys does, select <guimenuitem>Describe Key</guimenuitem> from
	the <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu and type it in&#8212;Emacs
	will tell you what it does.  You can also use the
	<guimenuitem>Command Apropos</guimenuitem> menu item to find
	out all the commands which contain a particular word in them,
	with the key binding next to it.</para>

      <para>By the way, the expression above means hold down the
	<keysym>Meta</keysym> key, press <keysym>x</keysym>, release
	the <keysym>Meta</keysym> key, type
	<userinput>replace-s</userinput> (short for
	<literal>replace-string</literal>&#8212;another feature of
	Emacs is that you can abbreviate commands), press the
	<keysym>return</keysym> key, type <userinput>foo</userinput>
	(the string you want replaced), press the
	<keysym>return</keysym> key, type bar (the string you want to
	replace <literal>foo</literal> with) and press
	<keysym>return</keysym> again.  Emacs will then do the
	search-and-replace operation you have just requested.</para>

      <para>If you are wondering what on earth the
	<keysym>Meta</keysym> key is, it is a special key that many
	<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> workstations have.  Unfortunately, PC's do not have one,
	so it is usually the <keycap>alt</keycap> key (or if you are
	unlucky, the <keysym>escape</keysym> key).</para>

      <para>Oh, and to get out of Emacs, do <command>C-x C-c</command>
	(that means hold down the <keysym>control</keysym> key, press
	<keysym>x</keysym>, press <keysym>c</keysym> and release the
	<keysym>control</keysym> key).  If you have any unsaved files
	open, Emacs will ask you if you want to save them.  (Ignore
	the bit in the documentation where it says
	<command>C-z</command> is the usual way to leave
	Emacs&#8212;that leaves Emacs hanging around in the
	background, and is only really useful if you are on a system
	which does not have virtual terminals).</para>

      <title>Configuring Emacs</title>

      <para>Emacs does many wonderful things; some of them are built
	in, some of them need to be configured.</para>

      <para>Instead of using a proprietary macro language for
	configuration, Emacs uses a version of Lisp specially adapted
	for editors, known as Emacs Lisp.  Working with Emacs Lisp can
	be quite helpful if you want to go on and learn something like
	Common Lisp.  Emacs Lisp has many features of Common Lisp,
	although it is considerably smaller (and thus easier to
	master).</para>

      <para>The best way to learn Emacs Lisp is to download the <link xlink:href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/emacs/elisp-manual-19-2.4.tar.gz">Emacs
	  Tutorial</link></para>

      <para>However, there is no need to actually know any Lisp to get
	started with configuring Emacs, as I have included a sample
	<filename>.emacs</filename> file, which should be enough to
	get you started.  Just copy it into your home directory and
	restart Emacs if it is already running; it will read the
	commands from the file and (hopefully) give you a useful basic
	setup.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>A sample <filename>.emacs</filename> file</title>

      <para>Unfortunately, there is far too much here to explain it in
	detail; however there are one or two points worth
	mentioning.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Everything beginning with a <literal>;</literal> is a comment
	    and is ignored by Emacs.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>In the first line, the
	    <literal>-*- Emacs-Lisp -*-</literal> is so that
	    we can edit the <filename>.emacs</filename> file itself
	    within Emacs and get all the fancy features for editing
	    Emacs Lisp.  Emacs usually tries to guess this based on
	    the filename, and may not get it right for
	    <filename>.emacs</filename>.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>The <keysym>tab</keysym> key is bound to an
	    indentation function in some modes, so when you press the
	    tab key, it will indent the current line of code.  If you
	    want to put a <token>tab</token> character in whatever
	    you are writing, hold the <keysym>control</keysym> key down
	    while you are pressing the <keysym>tab</keysym> key.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>This file supports syntax highlighting for C, C++,
	    Perl, Lisp and Scheme, by guessing the language from the
	    filename.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Emacs already has a pre-defined function called
	    <function>next-error</function>.  In a compilation output
	    window, this allows you to move from one compilation error
	    to the next by doing <command>M-n</command>; we define a
	    complementary function,
	    <function>previous-error</function>, that allows you to go
	    to a previous error by doing <command>M-p</command>.  The
	    nicest feature of all is that <command>C-c C-c</command>
	    will open up the source file in which the error occurred
	    and jump to the appropriate line.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>We enable Emacs's ability to act as a server, so that
	    if you are doing something outside Emacs and you want to
	    edit a file, you can just type in</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>emacsclient <replaceable>filename</replaceable></userinput>
	  </screen>

	  <para>and then you can edit the file in your
	    Emacs!

	    <footnote>
	      <para>Many Emacs users set their <envar>EDITOR</envar>
		environment to
		<literal>emacsclient</literal> so this happens every
		time they need to edit a file.</para>

      <title>Extending the Range of Languages Emacs Understands</title>

      <para>Now, this is all very well if you only want to program in
	the languages already catered for in the
	<filename>.emacs</filename> file (C, C++, Perl, Lisp and
	Scheme), but what happens if a new language called
	<quote>whizbang</quote> comes out, full of exciting
	features?</para>

      <para>The first thing to do is find out if whizbang comes with
	any files that tell Emacs about the language.  These usually
	end in <filename>.el</filename>, short for <quote>Emacs
	  Lisp</quote>.  For example, if whizbang is a FreeBSD port, we
	can locate these files by doing</para>

      <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>find /usr/ports/lang/whizbang -name "*.el" -print</userinput></screen>

      <para>and install them by copying them into the Emacs site Lisp
	directory.  On FreeBSD, this is
	<filename>/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp</filename>.</para>

      <para>So for example, if the output from the find command
	was</para>

      <screen>/usr/ports/lang/whizbang/work/misc/whizbang.el</screen>

      <para>we would do</para>

      <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>cp /usr/ports/lang/whizbang/work/misc/whizbang.el /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp</userinput></screen>

      <para>Next, we need to decide what extension whizbang source
	files have.  Let's say for the sake of argument that they all
	end in <filename>.wiz</filename>.  We need to add an entry to
	our <filename>.emacs</filename> file to make sure Emacs will
	be able to use the information in
	<filename>whizbang.el</filename>.</para>

      <para>Find the <symbol>auto-mode-alist entry</symbol> in
	<filename>.emacs</filename> and add a line for whizbang, such
	as:</para>

      <programlisting><lineannotation>&#8230;</lineannotation>
("\\.lsp$" . lisp-mode)
("\\.wiz$" . whizbang-mode)
("\\.scm$" . scheme-mode)
<lineannotation>&#8230;</lineannotation></programlisting>

      <para>This means that Emacs will automatically go into
	<function>whizbang-mode</function> when you edit a file ending
	in <filename>.wiz</filename>.</para>

      <para>Just below this, you will find the
	<symbol>font-lock-auto-mode-list</symbol> entry.  Add
	<function>whizbang-mode</function> to it like so:</para>

      <programlisting>;; Auto font lock mode
(defvar font-lock-auto-mode-list
  (list 'c-mode 'c++-mode 'c++-c-mode 'emacs-lisp-mode 'whizbang-mode 'lisp-mode 'perl-mode 'scheme-mode)
  "List of modes to always start in font-lock-mode")</programlisting>

      <para>This means that Emacs will always enable
	<function>font-lock-mode</function> (ie syntax highlighting)
	when editing a <filename>.wiz</filename> file.</para>

      <para>And that is all that is needed.  If there is anything else
	you want done automatically when you open up a
	<filename>.wiz</filename> file, you can add a
	<function>whizbang-mode hook</function> (see
	<function>my-scheme-mode-hook</function> for a simple example
	that adds <function>auto-indent</function>).</para>

      <sect1 xml:id="secure-synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title>

      <para>This chapter describes some of the security issues that
      have plagued <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> programmers for decades and some of the new
      tools available to help programmers avoid writing exploitable
      code.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 xml:id="secure-philosophy"><title>Secure Design
      Methodology</title>

      <para>Writing secure applications takes a very scrutinous and
      pessimistic outlook on life.  Applications should be run with
      the principle of <quote>least privilege</quote> so that no
      process is ever running with more than the bare minimum access
      that it needs to accomplish its function.  Previously tested
      code should be reused whenever possible to avoid common
      mistakes that others may have already fixed.</para>

      <para>One of the pitfalls of the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> environment is how easy it
      is to make assumptions about the sanity of the environment.
      Applications should never trust user input (in all its forms),
      system resources, inter-process communication, or the timing of
      events.  <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> processes do not execute synchronously so logical
      operations are rarely atomic.</para>
      </sect1>

      <sect1 xml:id="secure-bufferov"><title>Buffer Overflows</title>

      <para>Buffer Overflows have been around since the very
      beginnings of the Von-Neuman <xref linkend="COD"/> architecture.

      <indexterm><primary>buffer overflow</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Von-Neuman</primary></indexterm>

      They first gained widespread notoriety in 1988 with the Morris
      Internet worm.  Unfortunately, the same basic attack remains

      <indexterm><primary>Morris Internet worm</primary></indexterm>

      effective today.
      By far the most common type of buffer overflow attack is based
      on corrupting the stack.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>stack</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>arguments</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Most modern computer systems use a stack to pass arguments
      to procedures and to store local variables.  A stack is a last
      in first out (LIFO) buffer in the high memory area of a process
      image.  When a program invokes a function a new "stack frame" is

      <indexterm><primary>LIFO</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>process image</primary>
	  <secondary>stack pointer</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      created.  This stack frame consists of the arguments passed to
      the function as well as a dynamic amount of local variable
      space.  The "stack pointer" is a register that holds the current

      <indexterm><primary>stack frame</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>stack pointer</primary></indexterm>

      location of the top of the stack.  Since this value is
      constantly changing as new values are pushed onto the top of the
      stack, many implementations also provide a "frame pointer" that
      is located near the beginning of a stack frame so that local
      variables can more easily be addressed relative to this
      value. <xref linkend="COD"/> The return address for function

      <indexterm><primary>frame pointer</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>process image</primary>
        <secondary>frame pointer</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>return address</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>stack-overflow</primary></indexterm>

      calls is also stored on the stack, and this is the cause of
      stack-overflow exploits since overflowing a local variable in a
      function can overwrite the return address of that function,
      potentially allowing a malicious user to execute any code he or
      she wants.</para>

      <para>Although stack-based attacks are by far the most common,
      it would also be possible to overrun the stack with a heap-based
      (malloc/free) attack.</para>

      <para>The C programming language does not perform automatic
      bounds checking on arrays or pointers as many other languages
      do.  In addition, the standard C library is filled with a
      handful of very dangerous functions.</para>

      <sect2><title>Example Buffer Overflow</title>

      <para>The following example code contains a buffer overflow
      designed to overwrite the return address and skip the
      instruction immediately following the function call.  (Inspired
      by <xref linkend="Phrack"/>)</para>

<programlisting>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void manipulate(char *buffer) {
  char newbuffer[80];
  strcpy(newbuffer,buffer);
}

int main() {
  char ch,buffer[4096];
  int i=0;

  while ((buffer[i++] = getchar()) != '\n') {};

  i=1;
  manipulate(buffer);
  i=2;
  printf("The value of i is : %d\n",i);
  return 0;
}</programlisting>

      <para>Let us examine what the memory image of this process would
      look like if we were to input 160 spaces into our little program
      before hitting return.</para>

      <para>[XXX figure here!]</para>

      <para>Obviously more malicious input can be devised to execute
      actual compiled instructions (such as exec(/bin/sh)).</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2><title>Avoiding Buffer Overflows</title>

      <para>The most straightforward solution to the problem of
      stack-overflows is to always use length restricted memory and
      string copy functions.  <function>strncpy</function> and
      <function>strncat</function> are part of the standard C library.

      <indexterm>
        <primary>string copy functions</primary>
	  <secondary>strncpy</secondary>
      </indexterm>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>string copy functions</primary>
	  <secondary>strncat</secondary>
      </indexterm>

      These functions accept a length value as a parameter which
      should be no larger than the size of the destination buffer.
      These functions will then copy up to `length' bytes from the
      source to the destination.  However there are a number of
      problems with these functions.  Neither function guarantees NUL
      termination if the size of the input buffer is as large as the

      <indexterm><primary>NUL termination</primary></indexterm>

      destination.  The length parameter is also used inconsistently
      between strncpy and strncat so it is easy for programmers to get
      confused as to their proper usage.  There is also a significant
      performance loss compared to <function>strcpy</function> when
      copying a short string into a large buffer since
      <function>strncpy</function> NUL fills up the size
      specified.</para>

      <para>Another memory copy implementation exists
      to get around these problems.  The
      <function>strlcpy</function> and <function>strlcat</function>
      functions guarantee that they will always null terminate the
      destination string when given a non-zero length argument.</para>

      <indexterm>
        <primary>string copy functions</primary>
	  <secondary>strlcpy</secondary>
      </indexterm>

        <sect3><title>Compiler based run-time bounds checking</title>

	<indexterm><primary>bounds checking</primary>
	<secondary>compiler-based</secondary></indexterm>

        <para>Unfortunately there is still a very large assortment of
        code in public use which blindly copies memory around without
        using any of the bounded copy routines we just discussed.
        Fortunately, there is a way to help prevent such attacks &#8212;
        run-time bounds checking, which is implemented by several
        C/C++ compilers.</para>

	<indexterm><primary>ProPolice</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>StackGuard</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>gcc</primary></indexterm>

	<para>ProPolice is one such compiler feature, and is integrated
	  into <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gcc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> versions 4.1 and later.  It replaces and
	  extends the earlier StackGuard <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gcc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> extension.</para>

	<para>ProPolice helps to protect against stack-based buffer
	  overflows and other attacks by laying pseudo-random numbers in
	  key areas of the stack before calling any function.  When a
	  function returns, these <quote>canaries</quote> are checked
	  and if they are found to have been changed the executable is
	  immediately aborted.  Thus any attempt to modify the return
	  address or other variable stored on the stack in an attempt to
	  get malicious code to run is unlikely to succeed, as the
	  attacker would have to also manage to leave the pseudo-random
	  canaries untouched.</para>

        <indexterm><primary>buffer overflow</primary></indexterm>

        <para>Recompiling your application with ProPolice is an
        effective means of stopping most buffer-overflow attacks, but
        it can still be compromised.</para>

  	<indexterm>
	  <primary>bounds checking</primary>
	  <secondary>library-based</secondary>
	</indexterm>

        <para>Compiler-based mechanisms are completely useless for
        binary-only software for which you cannot recompile.  For
        these situations there are a number of libraries which
        re-implement the unsafe functions of the C-library
        (<function>strcpy</function>, <function>fscanf</function>,
        <function>getwd</function>, etc..) and ensure that these
        functions can never write past the stack pointer.</para>

        </itemizedlist>

	<para>Unfortunately these library-based defenses have a number
        of shortcomings.  These libraries only protect against a very
        small set of security related issues and they neglect to fix
        the actual problem.  These defenses may fail if the
        application was compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer.  Also, the
        LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables can be
        overwritten/unset by the user.</para>

      <sect1 xml:id="secure-setuid"><title>SetUID issues</title>

      <indexterm><primary>seteuid</primary></indexterm>

      <para>There are at least 6 different IDs associated with any
      given process.  Because of this you have to be very careful with
      the access that your process has at any given time.  In
      particular, all seteuid applications should give up their

      <indexterm><primary>chroot()</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The traditional method of restricting a process
      is with the <function>chroot()</function> system call.  This
      system call changes the root directory from which all other
      paths are referenced for a process and any child processes.  For
      this call to succeed the process must have execute (search)
      permission on the directory being referenced.  The new
      environment does not actually take effect until you
      <function>chdir()</function> into your new environment.  It
      should also be noted that a process can easily break out of a
      chroot environment if it has root privilege.  This could be
      accomplished by creating device nodes to read kernel memory,
      attaching a debugger to a process outside of the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>chroot</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
      environment, or in
      many other creative ways.</para>

      <para>The behavior of the <function>chroot()</function> system
      call can be controlled somewhat with the
      kern.chroot_allow_open_directories <command>sysctl</command>
      variable.  When this value is set to 0,
      <function>chroot()</function> will fail with EPERM if there are
      any directories open.  If set to the default value of 1, then
      <function>chroot()</function> will fail with EPERM if there are
      any directories open and the process is already subject to a
      <function>chroot()</function> call.  For any other value, the
      check for open directories will be bypassed completely.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>jail</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The concept of a Jail extends upon the
      <function>chroot()</function> by limiting the powers of the
      superuser to create a true `virtual server'.  Once a prison is
      set up all network communication must take place through the
      specified IP address, and the power of "root privilege" in this
      jail is severely constrained.</para>

      <para>While in a prison, any tests of superuser power within the
      kernel using the <function>suser()</function> call will fail.
      However, some calls to <function>suser()</function> have been
      changed to a new interface <function>suser_xxx()</function>.
      This function is responsible for recognizing or denying access
      to superuser power for imprisoned processes.</para>

      <para>To make your application more useful for speakers of other
	languages, we hope that you will program I18N compliant.  The GNU
	gcc compiler and GUI libraries like QT and GTK support I18N through
	special handling of strings.  Making a program I18N compliant is
	very easy.  It allows contributors to port your application to
	other languages quickly.  Refer to the library specific I18N
	documentation for more details.</para>

      <para>In contrast with common perception, I18N compliant code is
	easy to write.  Usually, it only involves wrapping your strings
	with library specific functions.  In addition, please be sure to
	allow for wide or multibyte character support.</para>

	  and inefficiently.  We hope that the various major groups in
	  I18N could congregate into a group effort similar to the Core
	  Team's responsibility.</para>

	<para>Currently, we hope that, when you write or port I18N
	  programs, you would send it out to each country's related
	  FreeBSD mailing list for testing.  In the future, we hope to
	  create applications that work in all the languages

      <para>Beyond the basic I18N functions, like supporting various input
	encodings or supporting national conventions, such as the different
	decimal	separators, at a higher level of I18N, it is possible to localize the
	messages written to the output by the various programs.  A common way of doing
	this is using the POSIX.1 NLS functions, which are provided as a part
	of the FreeBSD base system.</para>

      <sect2 xml:id="nls-catalogs">
	<title>Organizing Localized Messages into Catalog Files</title>

	<para>POSIX.1 NLS is based on catalog files, which contain the
	  localized messages in the desired encoding.  The messages are
	  organized into sets and each message is identified by an integer
	  number in the containing set.  The catalog files are conventionally
	  named after the locale they contain localized messages for, followed
	  by the <literal>.msg</literal> extension.  For instance, the
	  Hungarian messages for ISO8859-2 encoding should be stored in a file
	  called <filename>hu_HU.ISO8859-2</filename>.</para>

	<para>These catalog files are common text files that contain the
	  numbered messages.  It is possible to write comments by starting
	  the line with a <literal>$</literal> sign.  Set boundaries are also separated by
	  special comments, where the keyword <literal>set</literal> must
	  directly follow the <literal>$</literal> sign.  The <literal>set</literal> keyword
	  is then followed by the set number.  For example:</para>

	<programlisting>$set 1</programlisting>

	<para>The actual message entries start with the message number and
	  followed by the localized message.  The well-known
	  modifiers from <citerefentry><refentrytitle>printf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> are accepted:</para>

	<programlisting>15 "File not found: %s\n"</programlisting>

	<para>The language catalog files have to be compiled into a binary
	  form before they can be opened from the program.  This conversion
	  is done with the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gencat</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> utility.  Its first argument is the
	  filename of the compiled catalog and its further arguments are the
	  input catalogs.  The localized messages can also be organized into
	  more catalog files and then all of them can be processed with
	  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gencat</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 xml:id="nls-using">
	<title>Using the Catalog Files from the Source Code</title>

	<para>Using the catalog files is simple.  To use
	  the related functions, <filename>nl_types.h</filename> must be included.  Before
	  using a catalog, it has to be opened with <citerefentry><refentrytitle>catopen</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
	  The function takes two arguments.  The first parameter is the name of the
	  installed and compiled catalog.  Usually, the name of the
	  program is used, such as <application>grep</application>.
	  This name will be used when looking for the compiled
	  catalog file.  The <citerefentry><refentrytitle>catopen</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> call looks for this file
	  in <filename>/usr/share/nls/<replaceable>locale</replaceable>/<replaceable>catname</replaceable></filename>
	  and in <filename>/usr/local/share/nls/<replaceable>locale</replaceable>/<replaceable>catname</replaceable></filename>,
	  where <literal>locale</literal> is the locale set and
	  <literal>catname</literal> is the catalog name being
	  discussed.  The second parameter is a constant, which can have
	  two values:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><literal>NL_CAT_LOCALE</literal>, which means that
	      the used catalog file will be based on
	      <envar>LC_MESSAGES</envar>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><literal>0</literal>, which means that
	      <envar>LANG</envar> has to be used to open
	      the proper catalog.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>The <citerefentry><refentrytitle>catopen</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> call returns a catalog identifier of
	  type <literal>nl_catd</literal>.  Please refer to the manual page for a list of possible returned error
	  codes.</para>

	<para>After opening a catalog <citerefentry><refentrytitle>catgets</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> can be used to retrieve
	  a message.  The first parameter is the catalog identifier returned
	  by <citerefentry><refentrytitle>catopen</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>, the second one is the number of the set, the
	  third one is the number of the messages, and the fourth one is a
	  fallback message, which will be returned if the requested message
	  cannot be retrieved from the catalog file.</para>

	<para>After using the catalog file, it must be closed by calling
	  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>catclose</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>, which has one argument, the catalog id.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 xml:id="nls-example">
	<title>A Practical Example</title>

	<para>The following example will demonstrate an easy solution on how to
	  use NLS catalogs in a flexible way.</para>

	<para>The below lines need to be put into a common header file of
	  the program, which is included into all source files where
	  localized messages are necessary:</para>

	<programlisting>
#ifdef WITHOUT_NLS
#define getstr(n)	 nlsstr[n]
#else
#include &lt;nl_types.h&gt;

extern nl_catd		 catalog;
#define getstr(n)	 catgets(catalog, 1, n, nlsstr[n])
#endif

extern char		*nlsstr[];</programlisting>

	<para>Next, put these lines into the global declaration part of the
	  main source file:</para>

	<programlisting>
#ifndef WITHOUT_NLS
#include &lt;nl_types.h&gt;
nl_catd	 catalog;
#endif

/*
 * Default messages to use when NLS is disabled or no catalog
 * is found.
 */
char    *nlsstr[] = {
        "",
/* 1*/  "some random message",
/* 2*/  "some other message"
};</programlisting>

	<para>Next come the real code snippets, which open, read, and
	  close the catalog:</para>

	<programlisting>
#ifndef WITHOUT_NLS
	catalog = catopen("myapp", NL_CAT_LOCALE);
#endif

...

printf(getstr(1));

...

#ifndef WITHOUT_NLS
	catclose(catalog);
#endif</programlisting>

	<sect3>
	  <title>Reducing Strings to Localize</title>

	  <para>There is a good way of reducing the strings that
	    need to be localized by using <application>libc</application>
	    error messages.  This is also useful to just avoid duplication
	    and provide consistent error messages for the common errors
	    that can be encountered by a great many of programs.</para>

	  <para>First, here is an example that does not use
	    <application>libc</application> error messages:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#include &lt;err.h&gt;
...
if (!S_ISDIR(st.st_mode))
	errx(1, "argument is not a directory");
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>This can be transformed to print an error message by
	    reading <varname>errno</varname> and printing an error message
	    accordingly:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#include &lt;err.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
...
if (!S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) {
	errno = ENOTDIR;
	err(1, NULL);
}
	  </programlisting>

	  <para>In this example, the custom string is eliminated, thus
	    translators will have less work when localizing the program
	    and users will see the usual <quote>Not a directory</quote>
	    error message when they encounter this error.  This message
	    will probably seem more familiar to them.  Please note that
	    it was necessary to include <filename>errno.h</filename> in order to directly
	    access <varname>errno</varname>.</para>

	  <para>It is worth to note that there are cases when
	    <varname>errno</varname> is set automatically by a preceding
	    call, so it is not necessary to set it explicitly:</para>

	  <programlisting>
#include &lt;err.h&gt;
...
if ((p = malloc(size)) == NULL)
	err(1, NULL);
	  </programlisting>
	</sect3>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 xml:id="nls-mk">
	<title>Making use of <filename>bsd.nls.mk</filename></title>

	<para>Using the catalog files requires few repeatable steps,
	  such as compiling the catalogs and installing them to the
	  proper location.  In order to simplify this process even
	  more, <filename>bsd.nls.mk</filename> introduces some macros.
	  It is not necessary to include <filename>bsd.nls.mk</filename>
	  explicitly, it is pulled in from the common Makefiles,
	  such as <filename>bsd.prog.mk</filename> or
	  <filename>bsd.lib.mk</filename>.</para>

	<para>Usually it is enough to define <varname>NLSNAME</varname>,
	  which should have the catalog name mentioned as the first
	  argument of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>catopen</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> and list the catalog files in
	  <varname>NLS</varname> without their <literal>.msg</literal>
	  extension.  Here is an example, which makes it possible to
	  to disable NLS when used with the code examples before.
	  The <varname>WITHOUT_NLS</varname> <citerefentry><refentrytitle>make</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> variable has
	  to be defined in order to build the program without NLS
	  support.</para>

	<programlisting>
.if !defined(WITHOUT_NLS)
NLS=	es_ES.ISO8859-1
NLS+=	hu_HU.ISO8859-2
NLS+=	pt_BR.ISO8859-1
.else
CFLAGS+=	-DWITHOUT_NLS
.endif</programlisting>

	<para>Conventionally, the catalog files are placed under the
	  <filename>nls</filename> subdirectory and
	  this is the default behaviour of <filename>bsd.nls.mk</filename>.
	  It is possible, though to override the location of the
	  catalogs with the <varname>NLSSRCDIR</varname> <citerefentry><refentrytitle>make</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	  variable.  The default name of the precompiled catalog files
	  also follow the naming convention mentioned before.  It can be
	  overridden by setting the <varname>NLSNAME</varname> variable.
	  There are other options to fine tune the processing of the catalog
	  files but usually it is not needed, thus they are not described
	  here.  For further information on <filename>bsd.nls.mk</filename>,
	  please refer to the file itself, it is short and easy to
	  understand.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>For other parts of the repository, or for sections not
	listed as having a maintainer, or when you are unsure who the
	active maintainer is, try looking at the recent commit history
	of the relevant parts of the source tree.  It is quite often
	the case that a maintainer is not explicitly named, but the
	people who are actively working in a part of the source tree
	for, say, the last couple of years are interested in reviewing
	changes.  Even if this is not specifically mentioned in the
	documentation or the source itself, asking for a review as a
	form of courtesy is a very reasonable thing to do.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>The role of the maintainer is as follows:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>The maintainer owns and is responsible for that code.
	  This means that he or she is responsible for fixing bugs and
	  answering problem reports pertaining to that piece of the
	  code, and in the case of contributed software, for tracking
	  new versions, as appropriate.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Changes to directories which have a maintainer defined
	  shall be sent to the maintainer for review before being
	  committed.  Only if the maintainer does not respond for an
	  unacceptable period of time, to several emails, will it be
	  acceptable to commit changes without review by the
	  maintainer.  However, it is suggested that you try to have
	  the changes reviewed by someone else if at all
	  possible.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>It is of course not acceptable to add a person or group
	  as maintainer unless they agree to assume this duty.  On the
	  other hand it does not have to be a committer and it can
	  easily be a group of people.</para>

    <para>Some parts of the FreeBSD distribution consist of software
      that is actively being maintained outside the FreeBSD project.
      For historical reasons, we call this
      <emphasis>contributed</emphasis> software.  Some examples are
      <application>sendmail</application>,
      <application>gcc</application> and
      <application>patch</application>.</para>

    <para>Over the last couple of years, various methods have been
      used in dealing with this type of software and all have some
      number of advantages and drawbacks.  No clear winner has
      emerged.</para>

    <para>Since this is the case, after some debate one of these
      methods has been selected as the <quote>official</quote> method
      and will be required for future imports of software of this
      kind.  Furthermore, it is strongly suggested that existing
      contributed software converge on this model over time, as it has
      significant advantages over the old method, including the
      ability to easily obtain diffs relative to the
      <quote>official</quote> versions of the source by everyone (even
      without direct repository access).  This will make it
      significantly easier to return changes to the primary developers
      of the contributed software.</para>

    <para>Ultimately, however, it comes down to the people actually
      doing the work.  If using this model is particularly unsuited to
      the package being dealt with, exceptions to these rules may be
      granted only with the approval of the core team and with the
      general consensus of the other developers.  The ability to
      maintain the package in the future will be a key issue in the
      decisions.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Because it makes it harder to import future versions
	minor, trivial and/or cosmetic changes are
	<emphasis>strongly discouraged</emphasis> on files that are
	still tracking the vendor branch.</para>

      <para>This section describes the vendor import procedure with
	<application>Subversion</application> in details.</para>

      <procedure>
	<step>
	  <title>Preparing the Tree</title>

	  <para>If this is your first import after the switch to
	    <acronym>SVN</acronym>, you will have to flatten and clean
	    up the vendor tree, and bootstrap merge history in the
	    main tree.  If not, you can safely omit this step.</para>

	  <para>During the conversion from <acronym>CVS</acronym> to
	    <acronym>SVN</acronym>, vendor branches were imported with
	    the same layout as the main tree.  For example, the
	    <application>foo</application> vendor sources ended up in
	    <filename>vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/dist/contrib/<replaceable>foo</replaceable></filename>,
	    but it is pointless and rather inconvenient.  What we
	    really want is to have the vendor source directly in
	    <filename>vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/dist</filename>,
	    like this:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/dist/contrib/<replaceable>foo</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn move $(svn list) ../..</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd ../..</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn remove contrib</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn propdel -R svn:mergeinfo</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Note that, the <literal>propdel</literal> bit is
	    necessary because starting with 1.5, Subversion will
	    automatically add <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> to any
	    directory you copy or move.  In this case, you will not
	    need this information, since you are not going to merge
	    anything from the tree you deleted.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>You may want to flatten the tags as well.  The
	      procedure is exactly the same.  If you do this, put off
	      the commit until the end.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>Check the <filename>dist</filename> tree and perform
	    any cleanup that is deemed to be necessary.  You may want
	    to disable keyword expansion, as it makes no sense on
	    unmodified vendor code.  In some cases, it can be even be
	    harmful.</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn propdel svn:keywords -R .</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Bootstrapping of <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> on
	    the target directory (in the main tree) to the revision
	    that corresponds to the last change was made to the vendor
	    tree prior to importing new sources is also needed:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd head/contrib/<replaceable>foo</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn merge --record-only <replaceable>svn_base</replaceable>/vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/dist@<replaceable>12345678</replaceable> .</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn commit</userinput></screen>

	  <para>where <replaceable>svn_base</replaceable> is the base
	    directory of your <acronym>SVN</acronym> repository, e.g.
	    <literal>svn+ssh://svn.FreeBSD.org/base</literal>.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Importing New Sources</title>

	  <para>Prepare a full, clean tree of the vendor sources.
	    With <acronym>SVN</acronym>, we can keep a full
	    distribution in the vendor tree without bloating the main
	    tree.  Import everything but merge only what is
	    needed.</para>

	  <para>Note that you will need to add any files that were
	    added since the last vendor import, and remove any that
	    were removed.  To facilitate this, you should prepare
	    sorted lists of the contents of the vendor tree and of the
	    sources you are about to import:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/dist</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn list -R | grep -v '/$' | sort &gt; ../<replaceable>old</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd ../<replaceable>foo-9.9</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>find . -type f | cut -c 3- | sort &gt; ../<replaceable>new</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <para>With these two files, the following command will list
	    list removed files (files only in
	    <filename><replaceable>old</replaceable></filename>):</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>comm -23 ../<replaceable>old</replaceable> ../<replaceable>new</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <para>While the command below will list added files (files
	    only in
	    <filename><replaceable>new</replaceable></filename>):</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>comm -13 ../<replaceable>old</replaceable> ../<replaceable>new</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <para>Let's put this together:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/<replaceable>foo-9.9</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>tar cf - . | tar xf - -C ../dist</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd ../dist</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>comm -23 ../<replaceable>old</replaceable> ../<replaceable>new</replaceable> | xargs svn remove</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>comm -13 ../<replaceable>old</replaceable> ../<replaceable>new</replaceable> | xargs svn add</userinput></screen>

	  <warning>
	    <para>If there are new directories in the new
	      distribution, the last command will fail.  You will have
	      to add the directories, and run it again.  Conversely,
	      if any directories were removed, you will have to remove
	      them manually.</para>
	  </warning>

	  <para>Check properties on any new files:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>All text files
		should have <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> set to
		<literal>native</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>All binary files should have
		<literal>svn:mime-type</literal> set to
		<literal>application/octet-stream</literal>, unless
		there is a more appropriate media type.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Executable files should have
		<literal>svn:executable</literal> set to
		<literal>*</literal>.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>There should be no other properties on any file in
		the tree.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <note>
	    <para>You are ready to commit, but you should first check
	      the output of <command>svn stat</command> and
	      <command>svn diff</command> to make sure everything is
	      in order.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>Once you have committed the new vendor release, you
	    should tag it for future reference.  The best and quickest
	    way is to do it directly in the repository:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn copy <replaceable>svn_base</replaceable>/vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/dist <replaceable>svn_base</replaceable>/vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/<replaceable>9.9</replaceable></userinput></screen>

	  <para>To get the new tag, you can update your working copy
	    of
	    <filename>vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable></filename>.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you choose to do the copy in the checkout
	      instead, do not forget to remove the generated
	      <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> as described
	      above.</para>
	  </note>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Merging to <emphasis>-HEAD</emphasis></title>

	  <para>After you have prepared your import, it is time to
	    merge.  Option <option>--accept=postpone</option> tells
	    <acronym>SVN</acronym> not to handle merge conflicts yet,
	    because they will be taken care of manually:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>cd head/contrib/<replaceable>foo</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn update</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn merge --accept=postpone <replaceable>svn_base</replaceable>/vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/dist</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Resolve any conflicts, and make sure that any files
	    that were added or removed in the vendor tree have been
	    properly added or removed in the main tree.  It is always
	    a good idea to check differences against the vendor
	    branch:</para>

	  <screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>svn diff --no-diff-deleted --old=<replaceable>svn_base</replaceable>/vendor/<replaceable>foo</replaceable>/dist --new=.</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The <option>--no-diff-deleted</option> option tells
	    <acronym>SVN</acronym> not to check files that are in the
	    vendor tree but not in the main tree.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>With <acronym>SVN</acronym>, there is no concept of
	      on or off the vendor branch.  If a file that previously
	      had local modifications no longer does, just remove any
	      left-over cruft, such as FreeBSD version tags, so it no
	      longer shows up in diffs against the vendor tree.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>If any changes are required for the world to build
	    with the new sources, make them now &#8212; and test until
	    you are satisfied that everything build and runs
	    correctly.</para>
	</step>

	<step>
	  <title>Commit</title>

	  <para>Now, you are ready to commit.  Make sure you get
	    everything in one go.  Ideally, you would have done all
	    steps in a clean tree, in which case you can just commit
	    from the top of that tree.  That is the best way to avoid
	    surprises.  If you do it properly, the tree will move
	    atomically from a consistent state with the old code to a
	    consistent state with the new code.</para>
	</step>
      </procedure>

    <title>Encumbered Files</title>

    <para>It might occasionally be necessary to include an encumbered
      file in the FreeBSD source tree.  For example, if a device
      requires a small piece of binary code to be loaded to it before
      the device will operate, and we do not have the source to that
      code, then the binary file is said to be encumbered.  The

    <para>If you are adding shared library support to a port or other
      piece of software that does not have one, the version numbers
      should follow these rules.  Generally, the resulting numbers
      will have nothing to do with the release version of the
      software.</para>

    <para>The three principles of shared library building are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Start from <literal>1.0</literal></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If there is a change that is backwards compatible, bump
	  minor number (note that ELF systems ignore the minor
	  number)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>If there is an incompatible change, bump major
	  number</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>For instance, added functions and bugfixes result in the
      minor version number being bumped, while deleted functions,
      changed function call syntax, etc. will force the major version
      number to change.</para>

    <para>Stick to version numbers of the form major.minor
      (<replaceable>x</replaceable>.<replaceable>y</replaceable>).
      Our a.out dynamic linker does not handle version numbers of the
      form
      <replaceable>x</replaceable>.<replaceable>y</replaceable>.<replaceable>z</replaceable>
      well.  Any version number after the <replaceable>y</replaceable>
      (i.e. the third digit) is totally ignored when comparing shared
      lib version numbers to decide which library to link with.  Given
      two shared libraries that differ only in the
      <quote>micro</quote> revision, <command>ld.so</command> will
      link with the higher one.  That is, if you link with
      <filename>libfoo.so.3.3.3</filename>, the linker only records
      <literal>3.3</literal> in the headers, and will link with
      anything starting with
      <replaceable>libfoo.so.3</replaceable>.<replaceable>(anything
	&gt;= 3)</replaceable>.<replaceable>(highest
	available)</replaceable>.</para>

    <note>
      <para><command>ld.so</command> will always use the highest
	<quote>minor</quote> revision.  For instance, it will use
	<filename>libc.so.2.2</filename> in preference to
	<filename>libc.so.2.0</filename>, even if the program was
	initially linked with <filename>libc.so.2.0</filename>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>In addition, our ELF dynamic linker does not handle minor
      version numbers at all.  However, one should still specify a
      major and minor version number as our
      <filename>Makefile</filename>s <quote>do the right thing</quote>
      based on the type of system.</para>

    <para>For non-port libraries, it is also our policy to change the
      shared library version number only once between releases.  In
      addition, it is our policy to change the major shared library
      version number only once between major OS releases (i.e. from
      6.0 to 7.0).  When you make a change to a system library that
      requires the version number to be bumped, check the
      <filename>Makefile</filename>'s commit logs.  It is the
      responsibility of the committer to ensure that the first such
      change since the release will result in the shared library
      version number in the <filename>Makefile</filename> to be
      updated, and any subsequent changes will not.</para>

	  and displays an up-to-date summary.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The scripts are maintained and were developed by Dag-Erling C. Smørgrav <email>des@FreeBSD.org</email>,
      and are now written in Perl, a move on from their original
      incarnation as shell scripts.  All scripts and configuration
      files are kept in <link xlink:href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/projects/tinderbox/">/projects/tinderbox/</link>.</para>

    <para>For more information about the tinderbox and tbmaster
      scripts at this stage, see their respective man pages:
      tinderbox(1) and tbmaster(1).</para>

    <section>
      <title>The <filename>index.cgi</filename> Script</title>

      <para>The <filename>index.cgi</filename> script generates the
	<acronym>HTML</acronym> summary of tinderbox and tbmaster
	logs.  Although originally intended to be used as a
	<acronym>CGI</acronym> script, as indicated by its name, this
	script can also be run from the command line or from a
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>cron</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> job, in which case it will look for logs in the
	directory where the script is located.  It will automatically
	detect context, generating <acronym>HTTP</acronym> headers
	when it is run as a <acronym>CGI</acronym> script.  It
	conforms to <acronym>XHTML</acronym> standards and is styled
	using <acronym>CSS</acronym>.</para>

      <para>The script starts in the <function>main()</function> block
	by attempting to verify that it is running on the official
	Tinderbox website.  If it is not, a page indicating it is not
	an official website is produced, and a <acronym>URL</acronym>
	to the official site is provided.</para>

      <para>Next, it scans the log directory to get an inventory of
	configurations, branches and architectures for which log files
	exist, to avoid hard-coding a list into the script and
	potentially ending up with blank rows or columns.  This
	information is derived from the names of the log files
	matching the following pattern:</para>

      <programlisting>tinderbox-$config-$branch-$arch-$machine.{brief,full}</programlisting>

      <para>The configurations used on the official Tinderbox build
	servers are named for the branches they build.  For example,
	the <literal>releng_8</literal> configuration is used to build
	<literal>RELENG_8</literal> as well as all still-supported
	release branches.</para>

      <para>Once all of this startup procedure has been successfully
	completed, <function>do_config()</function> is called for each
	configuration.</para>

      <para>The <function>do_config()</function> function generates
	<acronym>HTML</acronym> for a single Tinderbox
	configuration.</para>

      <para>It works by first generating a header row, then iterating
	over each branch build with the specified configuration,
	producing a single row of results for each in the following
	manner:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>For each item:</para>

		</listitem>
	      </itemizedlist>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The <function>success()</function> function mentioned
	above scans a brief log file for the string <quote>tinderbox
	  run completed</quote> in order to determine whether the
	build was successful.</para>

      <para>Configurations and branches are sorted according to their
	branch rank.  This is computed as follows:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><literal>HEAD</literal> and <literal>CURRENT</literal>
	    have rank 9999.</para>
	</listitem>

	    has rank <replaceable>xxyy</replaceable>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This means that <literal>HEAD</literal> always ranks
	highest, and <literal>RELENG</literal> branches are ranked in
	numerical order, with each <literal>STABLE</literal> branch
	ranking higher than the release branches forked off of it.
	For instance, for FreeBSD 8, the order from highest to
	lowest would be:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The colors that Tinderbox uses for each cell in the table
	are defined by <acronym>CSS</acronym>.  Successful builds are
	displayed with green text; unsuccessful builds are displayed
	with red text.  The color fades as time passes since the

  <sect1 xml:id="sockets-synopsis">
    <title>Synopsis</title>

    <para><acronym>BSD</acronym> sockets take interprocess
      communications to a new level. It is no longer necessary for the
      communicating processes to run on the same machine. They still
      <emphasis>can</emphasis>, but they do not have to.</para>

    <para>Not only do these processes not have to run on the same
      machine, they do not have to run under the same operating
      system. Thanks to <acronym>BSD</acronym> sockets, your FreeBSD
      software can smoothly cooperate with a program running on a
      <trademark class="registered">Macintosh</trademark>, another one running on a <trademark>Sun</trademark> workstation, yet another
      one running under <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark> 2000, all connected with an
      Ethernet-based local area network.</para>

    <para>But your software can equally well cooperate with processes
      running in another building, or on another continent, inside a
      submarine, or a space shuttle.</para>

    <para>It can also cooperate with processes that are not part of a
      computer (at least not in the strict sense of the word), but of
      such devices as printers, digital cameras, medical equipment.
      Just about anything capable of digital communications.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="sockets-diversity">
    <title>Networking and Diversity</title>

    <para>We have already hinted on the <emphasis>diversity</emphasis>
      of networking. Many different systems have to talk to each
      other. And they have to speak the same language. They also have
      to <emphasis>understand</emphasis> the same language the same
      way.</para>

    <para>People often think that <emphasis>body language</emphasis>
      is universal. But it is not. Back in my early teens, my father
      took me to Bulgaria. We were sitting at a table in a park in
      Sofia, when a vendor approached us trying to sell us some
      roasted almonds.</para>

    <para>I had not learned much Bulgarian by then, so, instead of
      saying no, I shook my head from side to side, the
      <quote>universal</quote> body language for
      <emphasis>no</emphasis>. The vendor quickly started serving us
      some almonds.</para>

    <para>I then remembered I had been told that in Bulgaria shaking
      your head sideways meant <emphasis>yes</emphasis>. Quickly, I
      started nodding my head up and down. The vendor noticed, took
      his almonds, and walked away. To an uninformed observer, I did
      not change the body language: I continued using the language of
      shaking and nodding my head. What changed was the
      <emphasis>meaning</emphasis> of the body language. At first, the
      vendor and I interpreted the same language as having completely
      different meaning. I had to adjust my own interpretation of that
      language so the vendor would understand.</para>

    <para>It is the same with computers: The same symbols may have
      different, even outright opposite meaning. Therefore, for
      two computers to understand each other, they must not only
      agree on the same <emphasis>language</emphasis>, but on the
      same <emphasis>interpretation</emphasis> of the language.
      </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="sockets-protocols">
    <title>Protocols</title>

    <para>While various programming languages tend to have complex
      syntax and use a number of multi-letter reserved words (which
      makes them easy for the human programmer to understand), the
      languages of data communications tend to be very terse. Instead
      of multi-byte words, they often use individual
      <emphasis>bits</emphasis>.  There is a very convincing reason
      for it: While data travels <emphasis>inside</emphasis> your
      computer at speeds approaching the speed of light, it often
      travels considerably slower between two computers.</para>

    <para>Because the languages used in data communications are so
      terse, we usually refer to them as
      <emphasis>protocols</emphasis> rather than languages.</para>

    <para>As data travels from one computer to another, it always uses
      more than one protocol. These protocols are
      <emphasis>layered</emphasis>.  The data can be compared to the
      inside of an onion: You have to peel off several layers of
      <quote>skin</quote> to get to the data.  This is best
      illustrated with a picture:</para>

    <para>In this example, we are trying to get an image from a web
      page we are connected to via an Ethernet.</para>

    <para>The image consists of raw data, which is simply a sequence
      of <acronym>RGB</acronym> values that our software can process,
      i.e., convert into an image and display on our monitor.</para>

    <para>Alas, our software has no way of knowing how the raw data is
      organized: Is it a sequence of <acronym>RGB</acronym> values, or
      a sequence of grayscale intensities, or perhaps of
      <acronym>CMYK</acronym> encoded colors? Is the data represented
      by 8-bit quanta, or are they 16 bits in size, or perhaps 4 bits?
      How many rows and columns does the image consist of? Should
      certain pixels be transparent?</para>

    <para>I think you get the picture...</para>

    <para>To inform our software how to handle the raw data, it is
      encoded as a <acronym>PNG</acronym> file. It could be a
      <acronym>GIF</acronym>, or a <acronym>JPEG</acronym>, but it is
      a <acronym>PNG</acronym>.</para>

    <para>And <acronym>PNG</acronym> is a protocol.</para>

    <para>At this point, I can hear some of you yelling,
      <emphasis><quote>No, it is not! It is a file
      format!</quote></emphasis></para>

    <para>Well, of course it is a file format. But from the
      perspective of data communications, a file format is a protocol:
      The file structure is a <emphasis>language</emphasis>, a terse
      one at that, communicating to our <emphasis>process</emphasis>
      how the data is organized. Ergo, it is a
      <emphasis>protocol</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>Alas, if all we received was the <acronym>PNG</acronym>
      file, our software would be facing a serious problem: How is it
      supposed to know the data is representing an image, as opposed
      to some text, or perhaps a sound, or what not? Secondly, how is
      it supposed to know the image is in the <acronym>PNG</acronym>
      format as opposed to <acronym>GIF</acronym>, or
      <acronym>JPEG</acronym>, or some other image format?</para>

    <para>To obtain that information, we are using another protocol:
      <acronym>HTTP</acronym>. This protocol can tell us exactly that
      the data represents an image, and that it uses the
      <acronym>PNG</acronym> protocol. It can also tell us some other
      things, but let us stay focused on protocol layers here.
      </para>

    <para>So, now we have some data wrapped in the <acronym>PNG</acronym>
      protocol, wrapped in the <acronym>HTTP</acronym> protocol.
      How did we get it from the server?</para>

    <para>By using <acronym>TCP/IP</acronym> over Ethernet, that is
      how.  Indeed, that is three more protocols. Instead of
      continuing inside out, I am now going to talk about Ethernet,
      simply because it is easier to explain the rest that way.</para>

    <para>Ethernet is an interesting system of connecting computers in
      a <emphasis>local area network</emphasis>
      (<acronym>LAN</acronym>).  Each computer has a <emphasis>network
      interface card</emphasis> (<acronym>NIC</acronym>), which has a
      unique 48-bit <acronym>ID</acronym> called its
      <emphasis>address</emphasis>. No two Ethernet
      <acronym>NIC</acronym>s in the world have the same address.
      </para>

    <para>These <acronym>NIC</acronym>s are all connected with each
      other. Whenever one computer wants to communicate with another
      in the same Ethernet <acronym>LAN</acronym>, it sends a message
      over the network. Every <acronym>NIC</acronym> sees the
      message. But as part of the Ethernet
      <emphasis>protocol</emphasis>, the data contains the address of
      the destination <acronym>NIC</acronym> (among other things). So,
      only one of all the network interface cards will pay attention
      to it, the rest will ignore it.</para>

    <para>But not all computers are connected to the same
      network. Just because we have received the data over our
      Ethernet does not mean it originated in our own local area
      network. It could have come to us from some other network (which
      may not even be Ethernet based) connected with our own network
      via the Internet.</para>

    <para>All data is transferred over the Internet using
      <acronym>IP</acronym>, which stands for <emphasis>Internet
      Protocol</emphasis>. Its basic role is to let us know where in
      the world the data has arrived from, and where it is supposed to
      go to. It does not <emphasis>guarantee</emphasis> we will
      receive the data, only that we will know where it came from
      <emphasis>if</emphasis> we do receive it.</para>

    <para>Even if we do receive the data, <acronym>IP</acronym> does
      not guarantee we will receive various chunks of data in the same
      order the other computer has sent it to us. So, we can receive
      the center of our image before we receive the upper left corner
      and after the lower right, for example.</para>

    <para>It is <acronym>TCP</acronym> (<emphasis>Transmission Control
      Protocol</emphasis>) that asks the sender to resend any lost
      data and that places it all into the proper order.</para>

    <para>All in all, it took <emphasis>five</emphasis> different
      protocols for one computer to communicate to another what an
      image looks like.  We received the data wrapped into the
      <acronym>PNG</acronym> protocol, which was wrapped into the
      <acronym>HTTP</acronym> protocol, which was wrapped into the
      <acronym>TCP</acronym> protocol, which was wrapped into the
      <acronym>IP</acronym> protocol, which was wrapped into the
      <acronym>Ethernet</acronym> protocol.</para>

    <para>Oh, and by the way, there probably were several other
      protocols involved somewhere on the way. For example, if our
      <acronym>LAN</acronym> was connected to the Internet through a
      dial-up call, it used the <acronym>PPP</acronym> protocol over
      the modem which used one (or several) of the various modem
      protocols, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...</para>

    <para>As a developer you should be asking by now,
      <emphasis><quote>How am I supposed to handle it
      all?</quote></emphasis></para>

    <para>Luckily for you, you are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supposed
      to handle it all. You <emphasis>are</emphasis> supposed to
      handle some of it, but not all of it. Specifically, you need not
      worry about the physical connection (in our case Ethernet and
      possibly <acronym>PPP</acronym>, etc). Nor do you need to handle
      the Internet Protocol, or the Transmission Control
      Protocol.</para>

    <para>In other words, you do not have to do anything to receive
      the data from the other computer. Well, you do have to
      <emphasis>ask</emphasis> for it, but that is almost as simple as
      opening a file.</para>

    <para>Once you have received the data, it is up to you to figure
      out what to do with it. In our case, you would need to
      understand the <acronym>HTTP</acronym> protocol and the
      <acronym>PNG</acronym> file structure.</para>

    <para>To use an analogy, all the internetworking protocols become
      a gray area: Not so much because we do not understand how it
      works, but because we are no longer concerned about it. The
      sockets interface takes care of this gray area for us:</para>

    <para><acronym>BSD</acronym> sockets are built on the basic <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>
      model: <emphasis>Everything is a file.</emphasis> In our
      example, then, sockets would let us receive an <emphasis>HTTP
      file</emphasis>, so to speak. It would then be up to us to
      extract the <emphasis><acronym>PNG</acronym> file</emphasis>
      from it.
      </para>

    <para>Because of the complexity of internetworking, we cannot just
      use the <function role="syscall">open</function> system call, or
      the <function>open()</function> C function. Instead, we need to
      take several steps to <quote>opening</quote> a socket.</para>

    <para>Once we do, however, we can start treating the
      <emphasis>socket</emphasis> the same way we treat any
      <emphasis>file descriptor</emphasis>: We can
      <function>read</function> from it, <function>write</function> to

	  <para>The one function used by both, clients and servers, is
	    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>socket</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>. It is declared this way:</para>

<programlisting>
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
</programlisting>

          <para>The return value is of the same type as that of

	    its value from the same pool as that of file handles.
	    That is what allows sockets to be treated the same way as
	    files.</para>

	  <para>The <varname>domain</varname> argument tells the
	    system what <emphasis>protocol family</emphasis> you want
	    it to use. Many of them exist, some are vendor specific,
	    others are very common. They are declared in
	    <filename>sys/socket.h</filename>.</para>

	  <para>Use <constant>PF_INET</constant> for
	    <acronym>UDP</acronym>, <acronym>TCP</acronym> and other
	    Internet protocols (<acronym>IP</acronym>v4).</para>

	  <para>Five values are defined for the
	    <varname>type</varname> argument, again, in
	    <filename>sys/socket.h</filename>.  All of them start with
	    <quote><constant>SOCK_</constant></quote>.  The most
	    common one is <constant>SOCK_STREAM</constant>, which
	    tells the system you are asking for a <emphasis>reliable
	    stream delivery service</emphasis> (which is
	    <acronym>TCP</acronym> when used with
	    <constant>PF_INET</constant>).</para>

	  <para>If you asked for <constant>SOCK_DGRAM</constant>, you
	    would be requesting a <emphasis>connectionless datagram
	    delivery service</emphasis> (in our case,
	    <acronym>UDP</acronym>).</para>

	  <para>If you wanted to be in charge of the low-level
	    protocols (such as <acronym>IP</acronym>), or even network
	    interfaces (e.g., the Ethernet), you would need to specify
	    <constant>SOCK_RAW</constant>.</para>

	  <para>Finally, the <varname>protocol</varname> argument
	    depends on the previous two arguments, and is not always
	    meaningful.  In that case, use <constant>0</constant> for

	    <para>This is on purpose: To use a telephone analogy, we

	  <para>Various functions of the sockets family expect the
 	    address of (or pointer to, to use C terminology) a small
 	    area of the memory. The various C declarations in the
 	    <filename>sys/socket.h</filename> refer to it as
 	    <varname>struct sockaddr</varname>. This structure is
 	    declared in the same file:</para>

<programlisting>

struct sockaddr {
	unsigned char	sa_len;		/* total length */

};
#define	SOCK_MAXADDRLEN	255		/* longest possible addresses */
</programlisting>

          <para>Please note the <emphasis>vagueness</emphasis> with

	    just as an array of <constant>14</constant> bytes, with
	    the comment hinting there can be more than
	    <constant>14</constant> of them.</para>

	  <para>This vagueness is quite deliberate. Sockets is a very
	    powerful interface. While most people perhaps think of it
	    as nothing more than the Internet interface&#8212;and most

	    nowadays&#8212;sockets can be used for just about
	    <emphasis>any</emphasis> kind of interprocess

	  <para>The <filename>sys/socket.h</filename> refers to the

            </textobject>
          </mediaobject>

	  <para>And on a PDP it might look different yet. But the
	    above two are the most common ways in use today.</para>

	  <para>Ordinarily, wanting to write portable code,
	    programmers pretend that these differences do not
	    exist. And they get away with it (except when they code in
	    assembly language). Alas, you cannot get away with it that
	    easily when coding for sockets.</para>

	  <para>Why?</para>

	  <para>Because when communicating with another computer, you
	    usually do not know whether it stores data <emphasis>most
	    significant byte</emphasis> (<acronym>MSB</acronym>) or
	    <emphasis>least significant byte</emphasis>
	    (<acronym>LSB</acronym>) first.</para>

	  <para>You might be wondering, <emphasis><quote>So, will
	    sockets not handle it for me?</quote></emphasis></para>

	  <para>It will not.</para>

	  <para>While that answer may surprise you at first, remember
 	    that the general sockets interface only understands the
 	    <varname>sa_len</varname> and <varname>sa_family</varname>
 	    fields of the <varname>sockaddr</varname> structure. You
 	    do not have to worry about the byte order there (of
 	    course, on FreeBSD <varname>sa_family</varname> is only 1
 	    byte anyway, but many other <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> systems do not have
 	    <varname>sa_len</varname> and use 2 bytes for
 	    <varname>sa_family</varname>, and expect the data in
 	    whatever order is native to the computer).</para>

	  <para>But the rest of the data is just
	    <varname>sa_data[14]</varname> as far as sockets
	    goes. Depending on the <emphasis>address
	    family</emphasis>, sockets just forwards that data to its
	    destination.</para>

	  <para>Indeed, when we enter a port number, it is because we
	    want the other computer to know what service we are asking
	    for. And, when we are the server, we read the port number
	    so we know what service the other computer is expecting
	    from us. Either way, sockets only has to forward the port
	    number as data. It does not interpret it in any way.</para>

	  <para>Similarly, we enter the <acronym>IP</acronym> address
	    to tell everyone on the way where to send our data
	    to. Sockets, again, only forwards it as data.</para>

	  <para>That is why, we (the <emphasis>programmers</emphasis>,
	    not the <emphasis>sockets</emphasis>) have to distinguish
	    between the byte order used by our computer and a
	    conventional byte order to send the data in to the other
	    computer.</para>

	  <para>We will call the byte order our computer uses the
	    <emphasis>host byte order</emphasis>, or just the
	    <emphasis>host order</emphasis>.</para>

	  <para>There is a convention of sending the multi-byte data
	    over <acronym>IP</acronym>
	    <emphasis><acronym>MSB</acronym> first</emphasis>.  This,
	    we will refer to as the <emphasis>network byte
	    order</emphasis>, or simply the <emphasis>network
	    order</emphasis>.</para>

	  <para>Now, if we compiled the above code for an Intel based
	    computer, our <emphasis>host byte order</emphasis> would
	    produce:</para>

          <para>Unfortunately, our <emphasis>host order</emphasis> is

	  <para>We have several ways of dealing with it. One would be

	    </para>

	  <programlisting>sa.sin_family      = AF_INET;
sa.sin_port        = 13 &lt;&lt; 8;
sa.sin_addr.s_addr = (((((18 &lt;&lt; 8) | 244) &lt;&lt; 8) | 43) &lt;&lt; 8) | 192;</programlisting>

           <para>This will <emphasis>trick</emphasis> our compiler
	     into storing the data in the <emphasis>network byte
	     order</emphasis>. In some cases, this is exactly the way
	     to do it (e.g., when programming in assembly
	     language). In most cases, however, it can cause a
	     problem.</para>

	   <para>Suppose, you wrote a sockets-based program in C. You
	     know it is going to run on a <trademark class="registered">Pentium</trademark>, so you enter all
	     your constants in reverse and force them to the
	     <emphasis>network byte order</emphasis>. It works
	     well.</para>

           <para>Then, some day, your trusted old <trademark class="registered">Pentium</trademark> becomes a
	     rusty old <trademark class="registered">Pentium</trademark>.  You replace it with a system whose
	     <emphasis>host order</emphasis> is the same as the
	     <emphasis>network order</emphasis>. You need to recompile
	     all your software. All of your software continues to
	     perform well, except the one program you wrote.</para>

	   <para>You have since forgotten that you had forced all of
	     your constants to the opposite of the <emphasis>host
	     order</emphasis>. You spend some quality time tearing out
	     your hair, calling the names of all gods you ever heard
	     of (and some you made up), hitting your monitor with a
	     nerf bat, and performing all the other traditional
	     ceremonies of trying to figure out why something that has
	     worked so well is suddenly not working at all.</para>

	   <para>Eventually, you figure it out, say a couple of swear
	     words, and start rewriting your code.</para>

	   <para>Luckily, you are not the first one to face the
	     problem. Someone else has created the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>htons</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> and
	     <citerefentry><refentrytitle>htonl</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> C functions to convert a
	     <varname>short</varname> and <varname>long</varname>
	     respectively from the <emphasis>host byte
	     order</emphasis> to the <emphasis>network byte
	     order</emphasis>, and the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ntohs</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ntohl</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	     C functions to go the other way.</para>

	   <para>On <emphasis><acronym>MSB</acronym>-first</emphasis>
	     systems these functions do nothing. On
	     <emphasis><acronym>LSB</acronym>-first</emphasis> systems
	     they convert values to the proper order.</para>

	   <para>So, regardless of what system your software is
	     compiled on, your data will end up in the correct order
	     if you use these functions.</para>

      <sect3 xml:id="sockets-client-functions">
        <title>Client Functions</title>

        <para>Typically, the client initiates the connection to the
	  server. The client knows which server it is about to call:
	  It knows its <acronym>IP</acronym> address, and it knows the
	  <emphasis>port</emphasis> the server resides at. It is akin
	  to you picking up the phone and dialing the number (the
	  <emphasis>address</emphasis>), then, after someone answers,
	  asking for the person in charge of wingdings (the

          <title><function>connect</function></title>

          <para>Once a client has created a socket, it needs to

          <para>The <varname>s</varname> argument is the socket, i.e.,

	    function. The <varname>name</varname> is a pointer to
	    <varname>sockaddr</varname>, the structure we have talked
	    about extensively. Finally, <varname>namelen</varname>
	    informs the system how many bytes are in our
	    <varname>sockaddr</varname> structure.</para>

          <para>If <function>connect</function> is successful, it
	    returns <constant>0</constant>. Otherwise it returns
	    <constant>-1</constant> and stores the error code in
	    <varname>errno</varname>.</para>

          <para>There are many reasons why
	    <function>connect</function> may fail.  For example, with
	    an attempt to an Internet connection, the
	    <acronym>IP</acronym> address may not exist, or it may be

	  <para>The child calls <function>listen</function>, then

</programlisting>

          <para>We start by creating a socket. Then we fill out the
	    <varname>sockaddr_in</varname> structure in
	    <varname>sa</varname>.  Note the conditional use of
	    <symbol>INADDR_ANY</symbol>:</para>

<programlisting>
    if (INADDR_ANY)
        sa.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
</programlisting>

          <para>Its value is <constant>0</constant>. Since we have
	    just used <function>bzero</function> on the entire
	    structure, it would be redundant to set it to
	    <constant>0</constant> again. But if we port our code to
	    some other system where <symbol>INADDR_ANY</symbol> is
	    perhaps not a zero, we need to assign it to
	    <varname>sa.sin_addr.s_addr</varname>. Most modern C
	    compilers are clever enough to notice that
	    <symbol>INADDR_ANY</symbol> is a constant. As long as it
	    is a zero, they will optimize the entire conditional
	    statement out of the code.</para>

	  <para>After we have called <function>bind</function>
	    successfully, we are ready to become a
	    <emphasis>daemon</emphasis>: We use
	    <function>fork</function> to create a child process. In
	    both, the parent and the child, the <varname>s</varname>
	    variable is our socket. The parent process will not need
	    it, so it calls <function>close</function>, then it
	    returns <constant>0</constant> to inform its own parent it
	    had terminated successfully.</para>

	  <para>Meanwhile, the child process continues working in the
	    background.  It calls <function>listen</function> and sets
	    its backlog to <constant>4</constant>. It does not need a
	    large value here because <emphasis>daytime</emphasis> is
	    not a protocol many clients request all the time, and
	    because it can process each request instantly anyway.</para>

	  <para>Finally, the daemon starts an endless loop, which
	    performs the following steps:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step><para> Call <function>accept</function>. It waits
	      here until a client contacts it. At that point, it
	      receives a new socket, <varname>c</varname>, which it
	      can use to communicate with this particular client.
	      </para></step>

            <step><para>It uses the C function
	      <function>fdopen</function> to turn the socket from a
	      low-level <emphasis>file descriptor</emphasis> to a
	      C-style <varname>FILE</varname> pointer. This will allow
	      the use of <function>fprintf</function> later on.
	      </para></step>

	    <step><para>It checks the time, and prints it in the
	      <emphasis><acronym>ISO</acronym> 8601</emphasis> format
	      to the <varname>client</varname> <quote>file</quote>. It
	      then uses <function>fclose</function> to close the
	      file. That will automatically close the socket as well.
	      </para></step>

	  </procedure>

	  <para>We can <emphasis>generalize</emphasis> this, and use
	    it as a model for many other servers:</para>

          <para>This flowchart is good for <emphasis>sequential
	    servers</emphasis>, i.e., servers that can serve one
	    client at a time, just as we were able to with our
	    <emphasis>daytime</emphasis> server. This is only possible
	    whenever there is no real <quote>conversation</quote>
	    going on between the client and the server: As soon as the
	    server detects a connection to the client, it sends out
	    some data and closes the connection. The entire operation
	    may take nanoseconds, and it is finished.</para>

	  <para>The advantage of this flowchart is that, except for
	    the brief moment after the parent
	    <function>fork</function>s and before it exits, there is
	    always only one <emphasis>process</emphasis> active: Our
	    server does not take up much memory and other system
	    resources.</para>

	  <para>Note that we have added <emphasis>initialize
	    daemon</emphasis> in our flowchart. We did not need to
	    initialize our own daemon, but this is a good place in the
	    flow of the program to set up any
	    <function>signal</function> handlers, open any files we
	    may need, etc.</para>

	  <para>Just about everything in the flow chart can be used
	    literally on many different servers. The
	    <emphasis>serve</emphasis> entry is the exception.  We
	    think of it as a <emphasis><quote>black
	    box</quote></emphasis>, i.e., something you design
	    specifically for your own server, and just <quote>plug it
	    into the rest.</quote></para>

	  <para>Not all protocols are that simple. Many receive a
	    request from the client, reply to it, then receive another
	    request from the same client. Because of that, they do not
	    know in advance how long they will be serving the
	    client. Such servers usually start a new process for each
	    client. While the new process is serving its client, the
	    daemon can continue listening for more connections.</para>

	  <para>Now, go ahead, save the above source code as
	    <filename>daytimed.c</filename> (it is customary to end
	    the names of daemons with the letter
	    <constant>d</constant>). After you have compiled it, try
	    running it:</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>./daytimed</userinput>
bind: Permission denied
<prompt>%</prompt></screen>

          <para>What happened here? As you will recall, the
	    <emphasis>daytime</emphasis> protocol uses port 13. But
	    all ports below 1024 are reserved to the superuser
	    (otherwise, anyone could start a daemon pretending to
	    serve a commonly used port, while causing a security
	    breach).</para>

	  <para>Try again, this time as the superuser:</para>

<screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>./daytimed</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt></screen>

          <para>What... Nothing? Let us try again:</para>

<screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>./daytimed</userinput>

bind: Address already in use
<prompt>#</prompt></screen>

          <para>Every port can only be bound by one program at a
	    time. Our first attempt was indeed successful: It started
	    the child daemon and returned quietly. It is still running
	    and will continue to run until you either kill it, or any
	    of its system calls fail, or you reboot the system.</para>

	  <para>Fine, we know it is running in the background. But is
	    it working?  How do we know it is a proper
	    <emphasis>daytime</emphasis> server?  Simple:</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>telnet localhost 13</userinput>

          <para><application>telnet</application> tried the new
	    <acronym>IP</acronym>v6, and failed. It retried with
	    <acronym>IP</acronym>v4 and succeeded.  The daemon
	    works.</para>

          <para>If you have access to another <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> system via
	    <application>telnet</application>, you can use it to test
	    accessing the server remotely. My computer does not have a
	    static <acronym>IP</acronym> address, so this is what I
	    did:</para>

          <para>By the way, <application>telnet</application> prints

  <sect1 xml:id="sockets-helper-functions">
    <title>Helper Functions</title>

    <para>FreeBSD C library contains many helper functions for sockets
      programming.  For example, in our sample client we hard coded
      the <systemitem class="fqdomainname">time.nist.gov</systemitem>
      <acronym>IP</acronym> address. But we do not always know the
      <acronym>IP</acronym> address.  Even if we do, our software is
      more flexible if it allows the user to enter the
      <acronym>IP</acronym> address, or even the domain name.
      </para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sockets-gethostbyname">
      <title><function>gethostbyname</function></title>

      <para>While there is no way to pass the domain name directly to
        any of the sockets functions, the FreeBSD C library comes with
        the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gethostbyname</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>gethostbyname2</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> functions,

<programlisting>
struct hostent * gethostbyname(const char *name);
struct hostent * gethostbyname2(const char *name, int af);
</programlisting>

      <para>Both return a pointer to the <varname>hostent</varname>
        structure, with much information about the domain. For our
        purposes, the <varname>h_addr_list[0]</varname> field of the
        structure points at <varname>h_length</varname> bytes of the
        correct address, already stored in the <emphasis>network byte
        order</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>This allows us to create a much more flexible&#8212;and

      <para>We now can type a domain name (or an <acronym>IP</acronym>

        default to <systemitem class="fqdomainname">time.nist.gov</systemitem>. However, even in
        this case we will use <function>gethostbyname</function>

      <para>Had we not known the correct port for the

      <para>You usually do know the port. But if you are developing a

        port. Some day, you will register the protocol and its port
        (if nowhere else, at least in your
        <filename>/etc/services</filename>, which is where
        <function>getservbyname</function> looks). Instead of
        returning an error in the above code, you just use the
        temporary port number.  Once you have listed the protocol in
        <filename>/etc/services</filename>, your software will find
        its port without you having to rewrite the code.</para>

    <para>We moved the <emphasis>serve</emphasis> from the
      <emphasis>daemon process</emphasis> to its own <emphasis>server
      process</emphasis>. However, because each child process inherits
      all open files (and a socket is treated just like a file), the
      new process inherits not only the <emphasis><quote>accepted
      handle,</quote></emphasis> i.e., the socket returned by the
      <function>accept</function> call, but also the <emphasis>top
      socket</emphasis>, i.e., the one opened by the top process right
      at the beginning.</para>

    <para>However, the <emphasis>server process</emphasis> does not
      need this socket and should <function>close</function> it
      immediately. Similarly, the <emphasis>daemon process</emphasis>
      no longer needs the <emphasis>accepted socket</emphasis>, and
      not only should, but <emphasis>must</emphasis>
      <function>close</function> it&#8212;otherwise, it will run out
      of available <emphasis>file descriptors</emphasis> sooner or
      later.</para>

    <para>After the <emphasis>server process</emphasis> is done
      serving, it should close the <emphasis>accepted
      socket</emphasis>. Instead of returning to
      <function>accept</function>, it now exits.
      </para>

    <para>Under <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>, a process does not really
      <emphasis>exit</emphasis>. Instead, it
      <emphasis>returns</emphasis> to its parent. Typically, a parent
      process <function>wait</function>s for its child process, and
      obtains a return value. However, our <emphasis>daemon
      process</emphasis> cannot simply stop and wait. That would
      defeat the whole purpose of creating additional processes. But
      if it never does <function>wait</function>, its children will
      become <emphasis>zombies</emphasis>&#8212;no longer functional
      but still roaming around.</para>

    <para>For that reason, the <emphasis>daemon process</emphasis>
      needs to set <emphasis>signal handlers</emphasis> in its
      <emphasis>initialize daemon</emphasis> phase. At least a
      <symbol>SIGCHLD</symbol> signal has to be processed, so the
      daemon can remove the zombie return values from the system and
      release the system resources they are taking up.</para>

    <para>That is why our flowchart now contains a <emphasis>process
      signals</emphasis> box, which is not connected to any other box.
      By the way, many servers also process <symbol>SIGHUP</symbol>,
      and typically interpret as the signal from the superuser that
      they should reread their configuration files. This allows us to
      change settings without having to kill and restart these
      servers.</para>

        <title>Neighbor Discovery</title>

        <para>Neighbor Discovery is fairly stable.  Currently Address
	Resolution, Duplicated Address Detection, and Neighbor Unreachability
	Detection are supported.  In the near future we will be adding Proxy
	Neighbor Advertisement support in the kernel and Unsolicited Neighbor
	Advertisement transmission command as admin tool.</para>

        <para>If DAD fails, the address will be marked "duplicated" and
	message will be generated to syslog (and usually to console).  The
	"duplicated" mark can be checked with <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ifconfig</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>.  It is
	administrators' responsibility to check for and recover from DAD
	failures.  The behavior should be improved in the near future.</para>

        <para>Some of the network driver loops multicast packets back to itself,
        even if instructed not to do so (especially in promiscuous mode).
        In such cases DAD may fail, because DAD engine sees inbound NS packet
        (actually from the node itself) and considers it as a sign of duplicate.
        You may want to look at #if condition marked "heuristics" in
        sys/netinet6/nd6_nbr.c:nd6_dad_timer() as workaround (note that the code
        fragment in "heuristics" section is not spec conformant).</para>

        <para>Neighbor Discovery specification (RFC2461) does not talk about
	neighbor cache handling in the following cases:</para>

	<orderedlist>
          <listitem>
	    <para>when there was no neighbor cache entry, node
	    received unsolicited RS/NS/NA/redirect packet without
	    link-layer address</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>neighbor cache handling on medium without link-layer
	    address (we need a neighbor cache entry for IsRouter bit)</para>
          </listitem>
	</orderedlist>

        <para>For first case, we implemented workaround based on discussions
	on IETF ipngwg mailing list.  For more details, see the comments in
	the source code and email thread started from (IPng 7155), dated
	Feb 6 1999.</para>

        <para>IPv6 on-link determination rule (RFC2461) is quite different
	from assumptions in BSD network code.  At this moment, no on-link
	determination rule is supported where default router list is empty
	(RFC2461, section 5.2, last sentence in 2nd paragraph - note that
	the spec misuse the word "host" and "node" in several places in
	the section).</para>

        <para>To avoid possible DoS attacks and infinite loops, only 10
	options on ND packet is accepted now.  Therefore, if you have 20
	prefix options attached to RA, only the first 10 prefixes will be
	recognized.  If this troubles you, please ask it on FREEBSD-CURRENT
	mailing list and/or modify nd6_maxndopt in
	<filename>sys/netinet6/nd6.c</filename>.  If there are high demands
	we may provide sysctl knob for the variable.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 xml:id="ipv6-scope-index">
        <title>Scope Index</title>

	<para>IPv6 uses scoped addresses.  Therefore, it is very important to
	specify scope index (interface index for link-local address, or
	site index for site-local address) with an IPv6 address.  Without
	scope index, scoped IPv6 address is ambiguous to the kernel, and
	kernel will not be able to determine the outbound interface for a
	packet.</para>

	<para>Ordinary userland applications should use advanced API
	(RFC2292) to specify scope index, or interface index.  For similar
	purpose, sin6_scope_id member in sockaddr_in6 structure is defined
	in RFC2553.  However, the semantics for sin6_scope_id is rather vague.
	If you care about portability of your application, we suggest you to
	use advanced API rather than sin6_scope_id.</para>

	<para>In the kernel, an interface index for link-local scoped address is
	embedded into 2nd 16bit-word (3rd and 4th byte) in IPv6 address.  For
	example, you may see something like:
	</para>

	<screen>	fe80:1::200:f8ff:fe01:6317
	</screen>

	<para>in the routing table and interface address structure (struct
	in6_ifaddr).  The address above is a link-local unicast address
	which belongs to a network interface whose interface identifier is 1.
	The embedded index enables us to identify IPv6 link local
	addresses over multiple interfaces effectively and with only a
	little code change.</para>

	<para>Routing daemons and configuration programs, like <citerefentry><refentrytitle>route6d</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ifconfig</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>, will need to manipulate the "embedded" scope
	index.  These programs use routing sockets and ioctls (like
	SIOCGIFADDR_IN6) and the kernel API will return IPv6 addresses with
	2nd 16bit-word filled in.  The APIs are for manipulating kernel
	internal structure.  Programs that use these APIs have to be prepared
	about differences in kernels anyway.</para>

	<para>When you specify scoped address to the command line, NEVER write
	the embedded form (such as ff02:1::1 or fe80:2::fedc).  This is not
	supposed to work.  Always use standard form, like ff02::1 or
	fe80::fedc, with command line option for specifying interface (like
	<command>ping6 -I ne0 ff02::1</command>).  In general, if a command
	does not have command line option to specify outgoing interface, that
	command is not ready to accept scoped address.  This may seem to be
	opposite from IPv6's premise to support "dentist office" situation.
	We believe that specifications need some improvements for this.</para>

	<para>Some of the userland tools support extended numeric IPv6 syntax,
	as documented in
	<filename>draft-ietf-ipngwg-scopedaddr-format-00.txt</filename>.  You
	can specify outgoing link, by using name of the outgoing interface
	like "fe80::1%ne0".  This way you will be able to specify link-local
	scoped address without much trouble.</para>

	<para>To use this extension in your program, you will need to use
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>getaddrinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>, and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>getnameinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> with NI_WITHSCOPEID.
	The implementation currently assumes 1-to-1 relationship between a
	link and an interface, which is stronger than what specs say.</para>

	<para>Most of the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration is implemented
	in the kernel.  Neighbor Discovery functions are implemented in the
	kernel as a whole.  Router Advertisement (RA) input for hosts is
	implemented in the kernel.  Router Solicitation (RS) output for
	endhosts, RS input for routers, and RA output for routers are
	implemented in the userland.</para>

	  <title>Assignment of link-local, and special addresses</title>

 	  <para>IPv6 link-local address is generated from IEEE802 address
	  (Ethernet MAC address).  Each of interface is assigned an IPv6
	  link-local address automatically, when the interface becomes up
	  (IFF_UP).  Also, direct route for the link-local address is added
	  to routing table.</para>

	  <para>Here is an output of netstat command:</para>

<screen>Internet6:
Destination                   Gateway                   Flags      Netif Expire
fe80:1::%ed0/64               link#1                    UC          ed0
fe80:2::%ep0/64               link#2                    UC          ep0</screen>

	  <para>Interfaces that has no IEEE802 address (pseudo interfaces
	  like tunnel interfaces, or ppp interfaces) will borrow IEEE802
	  address from other interfaces, such as Ethernet interfaces,
	  whenever possible.  If there is no IEEE802 hardware attached,
	  a last resort pseudo-random value, MD5(hostname), will
	  be used as source of link-local address.  If it is not suitable
	  for your usage, you will need to configure the link-local address
	  manually.</para>

	  <para>If an interface is not capable of handling IPv6 (such as
	  lack of multicast support), link-local address will not be
	  assigned to that interface.  See section 2 for details.</para>

	  <para>Each interface joins the solicited multicast address and the
	  link-local all-nodes multicast addresses (e.g. fe80::1:ff01:6317
	  and ff02::1, respectively, on the link the interface is attached).
	  In addition to a link-local address, the loopback address (::1)
	  will be assigned to the loopback interface.  Also, ::1/128 and
	  ff01::/32 are automatically added to routing table, and loopback
	  interface joins node-local multicast group ff01::1.</para>

	  <title>Stateless address autoconfiguration on hosts</title>

	  <para>In IPv6 specification, nodes are separated into two categories:
	  <emphasis>routers</emphasis> and <emphasis>hosts</emphasis>.  Routers
	  forward packets addressed to others, hosts does not forward the
	  packets.  net.inet6.ip6.forwarding defines whether this node is
	  router or host (router if it is 1, host if it is 0).</para>

	  <para>When a host hears Router Advertisement from the router, a host
	  may autoconfigure itself by stateless address autoconfiguration.
	  This behavior can be controlled by net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv (host
	  autoconfigures itself if it is set to 1).  By autoconfiguration,
	  network address prefix for the receiving interface (usually global
	  address prefix) is added.  Default route is also configured.
	  Routers periodically generate Router Advertisement packets.  To
	  request an adjacent router to generate RA packet, a host can
	  transmit Router Solicitation.  To generate a RS packet at any time,
	  use the <emphasis>rtsol</emphasis> command.  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rtsold</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> daemon is
	  also available.  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rtsold</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> generates Router Solicitation whenever
	  necessary, and it works great for nomadic usage (notebooks/laptops).
	  If one wishes to ignore Router Advertisements, use sysctl to set
	  net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv to 0.</para>

	  <para>To generate Router Advertisement from a router, use the
	  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rtadvd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> daemon.</para>

	  <para>Note that, IPv6 specification assumes the following items, and
	  nonconforming cases are left unspecified:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Only hosts will listen to router advertisements</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Hosts have single network interface (except loopback)</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>Therefore, this is unwise to enable net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv
	  on routers, or multi-interface host.  A misconfigured node can
	  behave strange (nonconforming configuration allowed for those who
	  would like to do some experiments).</para>

	  <para>To summarize the sysctl knob:</para>

        <screen>	accept_rtadv	forwarding	role of the node
	---		---		---
	0		0		host (to be manually configured)
	0		1		router
	1		0		autoconfigured host
					(spec assumes that host has single
					interface only, autoconfigured host
					with multiple interface is
					out-of-scope)
	1		1		invalid, or experimental
					(out-of-scope of spec)</screen>

	  <para>RFC2462 has validation rule against incoming RA prefix
	  information option, in 5.5.3 (e).  This is to protect hosts from
	  malicious (or misconfigured) routers that advertise very short
	  prefix lifetime.  There was an update from Jim Bound to ipngwg
	  mailing list (look for "(ipng 6712)" in the archive) and it is
	  implemented Jim's update.</para>

	<title>Source Address Selection</title>

	<para>Current source selection rule is scope oriented (there are some

	address is selected by the following rule:</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
  	    <para>If the source address is explicitly specified by
	    the user (e.g.  via the advanced API), the specified address
	    is used.</para>

	    <para>If there is an address assigned to the outgoing

	    <para>This is the most typical case.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If there is no address that satisfies the above
	    condition, choose a global address assigned to one of
	    the interfaces on the sending node.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If there is no address that satisfies the above condition,

	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>If there is no address that satisfies the above condition,
	    choose the address associated with the routing table entry for the
	    destination.  This is the last resort, which may cause scope
	    violation.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<para>For instance, ::1 is selected for ff01::1,
	fe80:1::200:f8ff:fe01:6317 for fe80:1::2a0:24ff:feab:839b (note
	that embedded interface index - described in <link linkend="ipv6-scope-index">23.5.1.3</link> - helps us
	choose the right source address.  Those embedded indices will not
	be on the wire).  If the outgoing interface has multiple address for
	the scope, a source is selected longest match basis (rule 3).  Suppose
	2001:0DB8:808:1:200:f8ff:fe01:6317 and 2001:0DB8:9:124:200:f8ff:fe01:6317
	are given to the outgoing interface.  2001:0DB8:808:1:200:f8ff:fe01:6317
	is chosen as the source for the destination 2001:0DB8:800::1.</para>

	<para>Note that the above rule is not documented in the IPv6 spec.
	It is considered "up to implementation" item.  There are some cases
	where we do not use the above rule.  One example is connected TCP
	session, and we use the address kept in tcb as the source.  Another
	example is source address for Neighbor Advertisement.  Under the spec
	(RFC2461 7.2.2) NA's source should be the target address of the
	corresponding NS's target.  In this case we follow the spec rather
	than the above longest-match rule.</para>

	<para>For new connections (when rule 1 does not apply), deprecated
	addresses (addresses with preferred lifetime = 0) will not be chosen
	as source address if other choices are available.  If no other choices
	are available, deprecated address will be used as a last resort.  If
	there are multiple choice of deprecated addresses, the above scope
	rule will be used to choose from those deprecated addresses.  If you
	would like to prohibit the use of deprecated address for some reason,
	configure net.inet6.ip6.use_deprecated to 0.  The issue related to
	deprecated address is described in RFC2462 5.5.4 (NOTE: there is
	some debate underway in IETF ipngwg on how to use "deprecated"

      <sect3 xml:id="ipv6-jumbo">
	<title>Jumbo Payload</title>

	<para>The Jumbo Payload hop-by-hop option is implemented and can
	be used to send IPv6 packets with payloads longer than 65,535 octets.
	But currently no physical interface whose MTU is more than 65,535 is
	supported, so such payloads can be seen only on the loopback
	interface (i.e. lo0).</para>

	<para>If you want to try jumbo payloads, you first have to reconfigure
	the kernel so that the MTU of the loopback interface is more than
	65,535 bytes; add the following to the kernel configuration file:</para>

	<para><literal>
	  options		"LARGE_LOMTU"		#To test jumbo payload
	</literal></para>

	<para>and recompile the new kernel.</para>

	<para>Then you can test jumbo payloads by the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ping6</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> command
	with -b and -s options.  The -b option must be specified to enlarge
	the size of the socket buffer and the -s option specifies the length
	of the packet, which should be more than 65,535.  For example,
	type as follows:</para>

	<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>ping6 -b 70000 -s 68000 ::1</userinput></screen>

	<para>The IPv6 specification requires that the Jumbo Payload option
	must not be used in a packet that carries a fragment header.  If
	this condition is broken, an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem message must
	be sent to the sender.  specification is followed, but you cannot
	usually see an ICMPv6 error caused by this requirement.</para>

	<para>When an IPv6 packet is received, the frame length is checked and
	compared to the length specified in the payload length field of the
	IPv6 header or in the value of the Jumbo Payload option, if any.  If
	the former is shorter than the latter, the packet is discarded and
	statistics are incremented. You can see the statistics as output of
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>netstat</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> command with `-s -p ip6' option:</para>

	<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>netstat -s -p ip6</userinput>
	  ip6:
		(snip)
		1 with data size &lt; data length</screen>

	<para>So, kernel does not send an ICMPv6 error unless the erroneous
	packet is an actual Jumbo Payload, that is, its packet size is more
	than 65,535 bytes.  As described above, currently no physical interface
	with such a huge MTU is supported, so it rarely returns an
	ICMPv6 error.</para>

	<para>TCP/UDP over jumbogram is not supported at this moment.  This
	is because we have no medium (other than loopback) to test this.
	Contact us if you need this.</para>

	<para>IPsec does not work on jumbograms.  This is due to some
	specification twists in supporting AH with jumbograms (AH header
	size influences payload length, and this makes it real hard to
	authenticate inbound packet with jumbo payload option as well as AH).

	    must be expanded to hold 4G + IPv6 header + link-layer header.
	    Therefore, it must be expanded to at least int64_t
	    (u_int32_t is NOT enough).</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>We mistakingly use "int" to hold packet length in many

	    <para>We mistakingly check for ip6_plen field of IPv6 header

	<title>Loop prevention in header processing</title>

	<para>IPv6 specification allows arbitrary number of extension headers
	to be placed onto packets.  If we implement IPv6 packet processing
	code in the way BSD IPv4 code is implemented, kernel stack may
	overflow due to long function call chain.  sys/netinet6 code
	is carefully designed to avoid kernel stack overflow.  Because of
	this, sys/netinet6 code defines its own protocol switch
	structure, as "struct ip6protosw" (see
	<filename>netinet6/ip6protosw.h</filename>).  There is no such
	update to IPv4 part (sys/netinet) for compatibility, but small
	change is added to its pr_input() prototype. So "struct ipprotosw"
	is also defined.  Because of this, if you receive IPsec-over-IPv4
	packet with massive number of IPsec headers, kernel stack may blow
	up.  IPsec-over-IPv6 is okay.  (Off-course, for those all IPsec
	headers to be processed, each such IPsec header must pass each
	IPsec check. So an anonymous attacker will not be able to do such an
	attack.)</para>

	<para>The following sections will give you more details, and how you can

	<para>Comments on listening side:</para>

	<para>It looks that RFC2553 talks too little on wildcard bind issue,
	especially on the port space issue, failure mode and relationship
	between AF_INET/INET6 wildcard bind.  There can be several separate
	interpretation for this RFC which conform to it but behaves differently.
	So, to implement portable application you should assume nothing
	about the behavior in the kernel.  Using <citerefentry><refentrytitle>getaddrinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> is the
	safest way.  Port number space and wildcard bind issues were discussed
	in detail on ipv6imp mailing list, in mid March 1999 and it looks
	that there is no concrete consensus (means, up to implementers).
	You may want to check the mailing list archives.</para>

	<para>If a server application would like to accept IPv4 and IPv6
	connections, there will be two alternatives.</para>

	<para>One is using AF_INET and AF_INET6 socket (you will need two
	sockets).  Use <citerefentry><refentrytitle>getaddrinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> with AI_PASSIVE into ai_flags,
	and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>socket</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry> and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>bind</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry> to all the addresses returned.
	By opening multiple sockets, you can accept connections onto the
	socket with proper address family.  IPv4 connections will be
	accepted by AF_INET socket, and IPv6 connections will be accepted
	by AF_INET6 socket.</para>

	<para>Another way is using one AF_INET6 wildcard bind socket.  Use
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>getaddrinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> with AI_PASSIVE into ai_flags and with
	AF_INET6 into ai_family, and set the 1st argument hostname to
	NULL. And <citerefentry><refentrytitle>socket</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry> and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>bind</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry> to the address returned.
	(should be IPv6 unspecified addr).  You can accept either of IPv4
	and IPv6 packet via this one socket.</para>

	<para>To support only IPv6 traffic on AF_INET6 wildcard binded socket
	portably, always check the peer address when a connection is made
	toward AF_INET6 listening socket.  If the address is IPv4 mapped
	address, you may want to reject the connection.  You can check the
	condition by using IN6_IS_ADDR_V4MAPPED() macro.</para>

	<para>To resolve this issue more easily, there is system dependent

	<para>Advise to application implementers: to implement a portable
	IPv6 application (which works on multiple IPv6 kernels), we believe

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>NEVER hardcode AF_INET nor AF_INET6.</para>

	    throughout the system.  Never use gethostby*(), getaddrby*(),
	    inet_*() or getipnodeby*(). (To update existing applications
	    to be IPv6 aware easily, sometime getipnodeby*() will be
	    useful. But if possible, try to rewrite the code to use
	    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>getaddrinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>getnameinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>.)</para>

	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>If you would like to use AF_INET6 socket for both IPv4 and
	IPv6 outgoing connection, you will need to use <citerefentry><refentrytitle>getipnodebyname</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
	When you would like to update your existing application to be IPv6
	aware with minimal effort, this approach might be chosen. But please
	note that it is a temporal solution, because <citerefentry><refentrytitle>getipnodebyname</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	itself is not recommended as it does not handle scoped IPv6 addresses
	at all.  For IPv6 name resolution, <citerefentry><refentrytitle>getaddrinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> is the
	preferred API. So you should rewrite your application to use
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>getaddrinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>, when you get the time to do it.</para>

	<para>When writing applications that make outgoing connections,
	story goes much simpler if you treat AF_INET and AF_INET6 as totally
	separate address family.  {set,get}sockopt issue goes simpler,
	DNS issue will be made simpler.  We do not recommend you to rely
	upon IPv4 mapped address.</para>

	<title>sockaddr_storage</title>

	<para>When RFC2553 was about to be finalized, there was discussion on
	how struct sockaddr_storage members are named.  One proposal is to
	prepend "__" to the members (like "__ss_len") as they should not be
	touched.  The other proposal was not to prepend it (like "ss_len")
	as we need to touch those members directly.  There was no clear
	consensus on it.</para>

	<para>As a result, RFC2553 defines struct sockaddr_storage as
	follows:</para>

	<screen>	struct sockaddr_storage {
		u_char	__ss_len;	/* address length */
		u_char	__ss_family;	/* address family */
		/* and bunch of padding */
	};
	</screen>

	<para>On the contrary, XNET draft defines as follows:</para>

	<screen>	struct sockaddr_storage {
		u_char	ss_len;		/* address length */
		u_char	ss_family;	/* address family */
		/* and bunch of padding */
	};
	</screen>

	<para>In December 1999, it was agreed that RFC2553bis should pick
	the latter (XNET) definition.</para>

	<para>Current implementation conforms to XNET definition, based on
	RFC2553bis discussion.</para>

	<para>If you look at multiple IPv6 implementations, you will be able
	to see both definitions.  As an userland programmer, the most

      <title>IPsec</title>

      <para>IPsec is mainly organized by three components.</para>

      <orderedlist>

	  <para>Policy Management</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Policy Management</title>

	<para>The kernel implements experimental policy management code.
	There are two way to manage security policy.  One is to configure
	per-socket policy using <citerefentry><refentrytitle>setsockopt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>.  In this cases, policy
	configuration is described in <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsec_set_policy</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>.  The other
	is to configure kernel packet filter-based policy using PF_KEY
	interface, via <citerefentry><refentrytitle>setkey</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

	<para>The policy entry is not re-ordered with its
	indexes, so the order of entry when you add is very significant.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Key Management</title>

	<para>The key management code implemented in this kit (sys/netkey)
	is a home-brew PFKEY v2 implementation.  This conforms to RFC2367.
	</para>

	<para>The home-brew IKE daemon, "racoon" is included in the
	kit (kame/kame/racoon).  Basically you will need to run racoon as
	daemon, then set up a policy to require keys (like
	<command>ping -P 'out ipsec esp/transport//use'</command>).
	The kernel will contact racoon daemon as necessary to exchange
	keys.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>AH and ESP handling</title>

	<para>IPsec module is implemented as "hooks" to the standard IPv4/IPv6
	processing.  When sending a packet, ip{,6}_output() checks if ESP/AH
	processing is required by checking if a matching SPD (Security
	Policy Database) is found.  If ESP/AH is needed,
	{esp,ah}{4,6}_output() will be called and mbuf will be updated
	accordingly.  When a packet is received, {esp,ah}4_input() will be
	called based on protocol number, i.e. (*inetsw[proto])().
	{esp,ah}4_input() will decrypt/check authenticity of the packet,
	and strips off daisy-chained header and padding for ESP/AH.  It is
	safe to strip off the ESP/AH header on packet reception, since we
	will never use the received packet in "as is" form.</para>

	<para>By using ESP/AH, TCP4/6 effective data segment size will be
	affected by extra daisy-chained headers inserted by ESP/AH.  Our
	code takes care of the case.</para>

	<para>Basic crypto functions can be found in directory "sys/crypto".
	ESP/AH transform are listed in {esp,ah}_core.c with wrapper functions.
	If you wish to add some algorithm, add wrapper function in
	{esp,ah}_core.c, and add your crypto algorithm code into
	sys/crypto.</para>

	<para>Tunnel mode is partially supported in this release, with the
	following restrictions:</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>IPsec tunnel is not combined with GIF generic tunneling
	    interface.  It needs a great care because we may create an
	    infinite loop between ip_output() and tunnelifp-&gt;if_output().
	    Opinion varies if it is better to unify them, or not.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>MTU and Don't Fragment bit (IPv4) considerations need more
	    checking, but basically works fine.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="kerneldebug-obtain">
    <title>Obtaining a Kernel Crash Dump</title>

    <para>When running a development kernel (e.g., FreeBSD-CURRENT), such as a
      kernel under extreme conditions (e.g., very high load averages,
      tens of thousands of connections, exceedingly high number of
      concurrent users, hundreds of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>jail</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>s, etc.), or using a
      new feature or device driver on FreeBSD-STABLE (e.g.,
      <acronym>PAE</acronym>), sometimes a kernel will panic.  In the
      event that it does, this chapter will demonstrate how to extract
      useful information out of a crash.</para>

    <para>A system reboot is inevitable once a kernel panics.  Once a
      system is rebooted, the contents of a system's physical memory
      (<acronym>RAM</acronym>) is lost, as well as any bits that are
      on the swap device before the panic.  To preserve the bits in
      physical memory, the kernel makes use of the swap device as a
      temporary place to store the bits that are in RAM across a
      reboot after a crash.  In doing this, when FreeBSD boots after a
      crash, a kernel image can now be extracted and debugging can
      take place.</para>

    <note><para>A swap device that has been configured as a dump
      device still acts as a swap device.  Dumps to non-swap devices
      (such as tapes or CDRWs, for example) are not supported at this time.  A
      <quote>swap device</quote> is synonymous with a <quote>swap
      partition.</quote></para></note>

    <para>Several types of kernel crash dumps are available: full memory
      dumps, which hold the complete contents of physical memory,
      minidumps, which hold only memory pages in use by the kernel
      (FreeBSD  6.2 and higher), and textdumps, which hold captured
      scripted or interactive debugger output (FreeBSD 7.1 and higher).
      Minidumps are the default dump type as of FreeBSD 7.0, and in most
      cases will capture all necessary information present in a full
      memory dump, as most problems can be isolated only using kernel
      state.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="config-dumpdev">
      <title>Configuring the Dump Device</title>

      <para>Before the kernel will dump the contents of its physical
	memory to a dump device, a dump device must be configured.  A
	dump device is specified by using the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>dumpon</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> command
	to tell the kernel where to save kernel crash dumps.  The
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>dumpon</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> program must be called after the swap partition
	has been configured with <citerefentry><refentrytitle>swapon</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>.  This is normally
	handled by setting the <varname>dumpdev</varname> variable in
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>rc.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> to the path of the swap device (the
	recommended way to extract a kernel dump) or
	<literal>AUTO</literal> to use the first configured swap
	device.  The default for <varname>dumpdev</varname> is
	<literal>AUTO</literal> in HEAD, and changed to
	<literal>NO</literal> on RELENG_* branches (except for RELENG_7,
	which was left set to <literal>AUTO</literal>).
	On FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE and later versions,
	<application>bsdinstall</application> will ask whether crash dumps
	should be enabled on the target system during the install process.</para>

      <tip><para>Check <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> or
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>swapinfo</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> for a list of swap devices.</para></tip>

        specified in <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rc.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> exists before a kernel

      <title>Extracting a Kernel Dump</title>

        <para>Once a dump has been written to a dump device, the dump
	  must be extracted before the swap device is mounted.
	  To extract a dump
	  from a dump device, use the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>savecore</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> program.  If
	  <varname>dumpdev</varname> has been set in <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rc.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
	  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>savecore</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> will be called automatically on the first
	  multi-user boot after the crash and before the swap device
	  is mounted.  The location of the extracted core is placed in
	  the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>rc.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry> value <varname>dumpdir</varname>, by
	  default <filename>/var/crash</filename> and will be named
	  <filename>vmcore.0</filename>.</para>

        <para>In the event that there is already a file called
          <filename>vmcore.0</filename> in
          <filename>/var/crash</filename> (or whatever
          <varname>dumpdir</varname> is set to), the kernel will
          increment the trailing number for every crash to avoid
          overwriting an existing <filename>vmcore</filename> (e.g.,
          <filename>vmcore.1</filename>).  While debugging, it is
          highly likely that you will want to use the highest version
          <filename>vmcore</filename> in
          <filename>/var/crash</filename> when searching for the right
          <filename>vmcore</filename>.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>If you are testing a new kernel but need to boot a different one in
      order to get your system up and running again, boot it only into single
      user mode using the <option>-s</option> flag at the boot prompt, and
      then perform the following steps:</para>

    <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>fsck -p</userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>mount -a -t ufs</userinput>       # make sure /var/crash is writable

<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>exit</userinput>                  # exit to multi-user</screen>

    <para>This instructs <citerefentry><refentrytitle>savecore</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> to extract a kernel dump
      from <filename>/dev/ad0s1b</filename> and place the contents in
      <filename>/var/crash</filename>.  Do not forget to make sure the
      destination directory <filename>/var/crash</filename> has enough
      space for the dump.  Also, do not forget to specify the correct path to your swap
      device as it is likely different than
      <filename>/dev/ad0s1b</filename>!</para></tip>

    <title>Debugging a Kernel Crash Dump with <command>kgdb</command></title>

    <note>
      <para>This section covers <citerefentry><refentrytitle>kgdb</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> as found in FreeBSD 5.3
	and later.  In previous versions, one must use
	<command>gdb -k</command> to read a core dump file.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Once a dump has been obtained, getting useful information
      out of the dump is relatively easy for simple problems.  Before
      launching into the internals of <citerefentry><refentrytitle>kgdb</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> to debug
      the crash dump, locate the debug version of your kernel
      (normally called <filename>kernel.debug</filename>) and the path
      to the source files used to build your kernel (normally
      <filename>/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>KERNCONF</replaceable></filename>,
      where <filename><replaceable>KERNCONF</replaceable></filename>
      is the <varname>ident</varname> specified in a kernel
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>config</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>).  With those two pieces of info, let the
      debugging commence!</para>

    <para>To enter into the debugger and begin getting information
      from the dump, the following steps are required at a minimum:</para>

    <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>cd /usr/obj/usr/src/sys/<replaceable>KERNCONF</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>kgdb kernel.debug /var/crash/vmcore.0</userinput></screen>

    <para>You can debug the crash dump using the kernel sources just like
      you can for any other program.</para>

    <para>This first dump is from a 5.2-BETA kernel and the crash
      comes from deep within the kernel.  The output below has been
      modified to include line numbers on the left.  This first trace
      inspects the instruction pointer and obtains a back trace.  The
      address that is used on line 41 for the <command>list</command>
      command is the instruction pointer and can be found on line
      17.  Most developers will request having at least this
      information sent to them if you are unable to debug the problem
      yourself.  If, however, you do solve the problem, make sure that
      your patch winds its way into the source tree via a problem
      report, mailing lists, or by being able to commit it!</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="kerneldebug-online-ddb">
    <title>On-Line Kernel Debugging Using DDB</title>

    <para>While <command>kgdb</command> as an off-line debugger provides a very
      high level of user interface, there are some things it cannot do.  The
      most important ones being breakpointing and single-stepping kernel
      code.</para>

    <para>If you need to do low-level debugging on your kernel, there is an
      on-line debugger available called DDB.  It allows setting of
      breakpoints, single-stepping kernel functions, examining and changing
      kernel variables, etc.  However, it cannot access kernel source files,
      and only has access to the global and static symbols, not to the full
      debug information like <command>gdb</command> does.</para>

    <para>To configure your kernel to include DDB, add the options

      <programlisting>options KDB</programlisting>
      <programlisting>options DDB</programlisting>

      to your config file, and rebuild.  (See <link xlink:href="@@URL_RELPREFIX@@/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html">The FreeBSD Handbook</link> for details on
      configuring the FreeBSD kernel).</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you have an older version of the boot blocks, your
	debugger symbols might not be loaded at all.  Update the boot blocks;
	the recent ones load the DDB symbols automatically.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Once your DDB kernel is running, there are several ways to enter
      DDB.  The first, and earliest way is to type the boot flag
      <option>-d</option> right at the boot prompt.  The kernel will start up
      in debug mode and enter DDB prior to any device probing.  Hence you can
      even debug the device probe/attach functions.  Users of FreeBSD-CURRENT
      will need to use the boot menu option, six, to escape to a command
      prompt.</para>

    <para>The second scenario is to drop to the debugger once the
      system has booted.  There are two simple ways to accomplish
      this.  If you would like to break to the debugger from the
      command prompt, simply type the command:</para>

    <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>sysctl debug.kdb.enter=1</userinput></screen>
    <note>
      <para>To force a panic on the fly, issue the following command:</para>
      <screen><prompt>#</prompt> <userinput>sysctl debug.kdb.panic=1</userinput></screen>
    </note>

    <para>Alternatively, if you are at the system console, you may use
      a hot-key on the keyboard.  The default break-to-debugger
      sequence is <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      <keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>ESC</keycap></keycombo>.  For
      syscons, this sequence can be remapped and some of the
      distributed maps out there do this, so check to make sure you
      know the right sequence to use.  There is an option available
      for serial consoles that allows the use of a serial line BREAK on the
      console line to enter DDB (<literal>options BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</literal>
      in the kernel config file).  It is not the default since there are a lot
      of serial adapters around that gratuitously generate a BREAK
      condition, for example when pulling the cable.</para>

    <para>The third way is that any panic condition will branch to DDB if the
      kernel is configured to use it.  For this reason, it is not wise to
      configure a kernel with DDB for a machine running unattended.</para>

    <para>To obtain the unattended functionality, add:</para>

    <programlisting>options	KDB_UNATTENDED</programlisting>

    <para>to the kernel configuration file and rebuild/reinstall.</para>

    <para>The DDB commands roughly resemble some <command>gdb</command>
      commands.  The first thing you probably need to do is to set a
      breakpoint:</para>

    <screen><userinput>break function-name address</userinput></screen>

    <para>Numbers are taken hexadecimal by default, but to make them distinct
      from symbol names; hexadecimal numbers starting with the letters
      <literal>a-f</literal> need to be preceded with <literal>0x</literal>
      (this is optional for other numbers).  Simple expressions are allowed,
      for example: <literal>function-name + 0x103</literal>.</para>

    <para>To exit the debugger and continue execution,
      type:</para>

    <screen><userinput>continue</userinput></screen>

    <para>To get a stack trace, use:</para>

    <screen><userinput>trace</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>Note that when entering DDB via a hot-key, the kernel is currently
	servicing an interrupt, so the stack trace might be not of much use
	to you.</para>
    </note>

    <para>If you want to remove a breakpoint, use</para>

    <screen><userinput>del</userinput>
<userinput>del address-expression</userinput></screen>

    <para>The first form will be accepted immediately after a breakpoint hit,
      and deletes the current breakpoint.  The second form can remove any
      breakpoint, but you need to specify the exact address; this can be
      obtained from:</para>

    <screen><userinput>show b</userinput></screen>

    <para>or:</para>

    <screen><userinput>show break</userinput></screen>

    <para>To single-step the kernel, try:</para>

    <screen><userinput>s</userinput></screen>

    <para>This will step into functions, but you can make DDB trace them until
      the matching return statement is reached by:</para>

    <screen><userinput>n</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>This is different from <command>gdb</command>'s
	<command>next</command> statement; it is like <command>gdb</command>'s
	<command>finish</command>.  Pressing <keycap>n</keycap> more than once
        will cause a continue.</para>
    </note>

    <para>To examine data from memory, use (for example):

      <screen><userinput>x/wx 0xf0133fe0,40</userinput>
<userinput>x/hd db_symtab_space</userinput>
<userinput>x/bc termbuf,10</userinput>
<userinput>x/s stringbuf</userinput></screen>

      for word/halfword/byte access, and hexadecimal/decimal/character/ string
      display.  The number after the comma is the object count.  To display
      the next 0x10 items, simply use:</para>

    <screen><userinput>x ,10</userinput></screen>

    <para>Similarly, use

      <screen><userinput>x/ia foofunc,10</userinput></screen>

      to disassemble the first 0x10 instructions of
      <function>foofunc</function>, and display them along with their offset
      from the beginning of <function>foofunc</function>.</para>

    <para>To modify memory, use the write command:</para>

    <screen><userinput>w/b termbuf 0xa 0xb 0</userinput>
<userinput>w/w 0xf0010030 0 0</userinput></screen>

    <para>The command modifier
      (<literal>b</literal>/<literal>h</literal>/<literal>w</literal>)
      specifies the size of the data to be written, the first following
      expression is the address to write to and the remainder is interpreted
      as data to write to successive memory locations.</para>

    <para>If you need to know the current registers, use:</para>

    <screen><userinput>show reg</userinput></screen>

    <para>Alternatively, you can display a single register value by e.g.

      <screen><userinput>p $eax</userinput></screen>

      and modify it by:</para>

    <screen><userinput>set $eax new-value</userinput></screen>

    <para>Should you need to call some kernel functions from DDB, simply
      say:</para>

    <screen><userinput>call func(arg1, arg2, ...)</userinput></screen>

    <para>The return value will be printed.</para>

    <para>For a <citerefentry><refentrytitle>ps</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> style summary of all running processes, use:</para>

    <screen><userinput>ps</userinput></screen>

    <para>Now you have examined why your kernel failed, and you wish to
      reboot.  Remember that, depending on the severity of previous
      malfunctioning, not all parts of the kernel might still be working as
      expected.  Perform one of the following actions to shut down and reboot
      your system:</para>

    <screen><userinput>panic</userinput></screen>

    <para>This will cause your kernel to dump core and reboot, so you can
      later analyze the core on a higher level with <command>gdb</command>.
      This command
      usually must be followed by another <command>continue</command>
      statement.</para>

    <screen><userinput>call boot(0)</userinput></screen>

    <para>Might be a good way to cleanly shut down the running system,
      <function>sync()</function> all disks, and finally, in some cases,
      reboot.  As long as
      the disk and filesystem interfaces of the kernel are not damaged, this
      could be a good way for an almost clean shutdown.</para>

    <screen><userinput>call cpu_reset()</userinput></screen>

    <para>This is the final way out of disaster and almost the same as hitting the
      Big Red Button.</para>

    <para>If you need a short command summary, simply type:</para>

    <screen><userinput>help</userinput></screen>

    <para>It is highly recommended to have a printed copy of the
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>ddb</refentrytitle><manvolnum>4</manvolnum></citerefentry> manual page ready for a debugging
      session.  Remember that it is hard to read the on-line manual while
      single-stepping the kernel.</para>

    <title>On-Line Kernel Debugging Using Remote GDB</title>

    <para>This feature has been supported since FreeBSD 2.2, and it is
      actually a very neat one.</para>

    <para>GDB has already supported <emphasis>remote debugging</emphasis> for
      a long time.  This is done using a very simple protocol along a serial
      line.  Unlike the other methods described above, you will need two
      machines for doing this.  One is the host providing the debugging
      environment, including all the sources, and a copy of the kernel binary
      with all the symbols in it, and the other one is the target machine that
      simply runs a similar copy of the very same kernel (but stripped of the
      debugging information).</para>

    <para>You should configure the kernel in question with <command>config
	-g</command> if building the <quote>traditional</quote> way.  If
      building the <quote>new</quote> way, make sure that
      <literal>makeoptions DEBUG=-g</literal> is in the configuration.
      In both cases, include <option>DDB</option> in the configuration, and
      compile it as usual.  This gives a large binary, due to the
      debugging information.  Copy this kernel to the target machine, strip
      the debugging symbols off with <command>strip -x</command>, and boot it
      using the <option>-d</option> boot option.  Connect the serial line
      of the target machine that has "flags 080" set on its uart device
      to any serial line of the debugging host.  See <citerefentry><refentrytitle>uart</refentrytitle><manvolnum>4</manvolnum></citerefentry> for
      information on how to set the flags on an uart device.
      Now, on the debugging machine, go to the compile directory of the target
      kernel, and start <command>gdb</command>:</para>

    <title>Kernel debugging with Dcons</title>

    <para><citerefentry><refentrytitle>dcons</refentrytitle><manvolnum>4</manvolnum></citerefentry> is a very simple console driver that is
      not directly connected with any physical devices.  It just reads
      and writes characters from and to a buffer in a kernel or
      loader.  Due to its simple nature, it is very useful for kernel
      debugging, especially with a <trademark class="registered">FireWire</trademark> device.  Currently, FreeBSD
      provides two ways to interact with the buffer from outside of
      the kernel using <citerefentry><refentrytitle>dconschat</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Dcons over <trademark class="registered">FireWire</trademark></title>

      <para>Most <trademark class="registered">FireWire</trademark> (IEEE1394) host controllers are
	based on the <acronym>OHCI</acronym> specification that
	supports physical access to the host memory.  This means that
	once the host controller is initialized, we can access the
	host memory without the help of software (kernel).   We can
	exploit this facility for interaction with <citerefentry><refentrytitle>dcons</refentrytitle><manvolnum>4</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>dcons</refentrytitle><manvolnum>4</manvolnum></citerefentry> provides similar functionality as a serial
	console.  It emulates two serial ports, one for the console
	and <acronym>DDB</acronym>, the other for
	<acronym>GDB</acronym>.  Because remote memory access is fully
	handled by the hardware, the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>dcons</refentrytitle><manvolnum>4</manvolnum></citerefentry> buffer is
	accessible even when the system crashes.</para>

      <para><trademark class="registered">FireWire</trademark> devices are not limited to those
	integrated into motherboards.  <acronym>PCI</acronym> cards
	exist for desktops, and a cardbus interface can be purchased
	for laptops.</para>

    <title>Glossary of Kernel Options for Debugging</title>

    <para>This section provides a brief glossary of compile-time kernel
      options used for debugging:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options KDB</literal>: compiles in the kernel
	  debugger framework.  Required for <literal>options DDB</literal>
	  and <literal>options GDB</literal>.  Little or no performance
	  overhead.  By default, the debugger will be entered on panic
	  instead of an automatic reboot.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options KDB_UNATTENDED</literal>: change the default
	  value of the <literal>debug.debugger_on_panic</literal> sysctl to
	  0, which controls whether the debugger is entered on panic.  When
	  <literal>options KDB</literal> is not compiled into the kernel, the
	  behavior is to automatically reboot on panic; when it is compiled
	  into the kernel, the default behavior is to drop into the debugger
	  unless <literal>options KDB_UNATTENDED</literal> is compiled in.
	  If you want to leave the kernel debugger compiled into the kernel
	  but want the system to come back up unless you're on-hand to use
	  the debugger for diagnostics, use this option.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options KDB_TRACE</literal>: change the default value
	  of the <literal>debug.trace_on_panic</literal> sysctl to 1, which
	  controls whether the debugger automatically prints a stack trace
	  on panic.  Especially if running with <literal>options
	  KDB_UNATTENDED</literal>, this can be helpful to gather basic
	  debugging information on the serial or firewire console while
	  still rebooting to recover.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options DDB</literal>: compile in support for the
	  console debugger, DDB.  This interactive debugger runs on whatever
	  the active low-level console of the system is, which includes the
	  video console, serial console, or firewire console.  It provides
	  basic integrated debugging facilities, such as stack tracing,
	  process and thread listing, dumping of lock state, VM state, file
	  system state, and kernel memory management.  DDB does not require
	  software running on a second machine or being able to generate a
	  core dump or full debugging kernel symbols, and provides detailed
	  diagnostics of the kernel at run-time.  Many bugs can be fully
	  diagnosed using only DDB output.  This option depends on
	  <literal>options KDB</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options GDB</literal>: compile in support for the
	  remote debugger, GDB, which can operate over serial cable or
	  firewire.  When the debugger is entered, GDB may be attached to
	  inspect structure contents, generate stack traces, etc.  Some
	  kernel state is more awkward to access than in DDB, which is able
	  to generate useful summaries of kernel state automatically, such
	  as automatically walking lock debugging or kernel memory
	  management structures, and a second machine running the debugger
	  is required.  On the other hand, GDB combines information from
	  the kernel source and full debugging symbols, and is aware of full
	  data structure definitions, local variables, and is scriptable.
	  This option is not required to run GDB on a kernel core dump.
	  This option depends on <literal>options KDB</literal>.
	  </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</literal>, <literal>options
	  ALT_BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</literal>: allow a break signal or
	  alternative signal on the console to enter the debugger.  If the
	  system hangs without a panic, this is a useful way to reach the
	  debugger.  Due to the current kernel locking, a break signal
	  generated on a serial console is significantly more reliable at
	  getting into the debugger, and is generally recommended.  This
	  option has little or no performance impact.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><literal>options INVARIANTS</literal>: compile into the kernel
	  a large number of run-time assertion checks and tests, which
	  constantly test the integrity of kernel data structures and the
	  invariants of kernel algorithms.  These tests can be expensive, so
	  are not compiled in by default, but help provide useful "fail stop"
	  behavior, in which certain classes of undesired behavior enter the
	  debugger before kernel data corruption occurs, making them easier
	  to debug.  Tests include memory scrubbing and use-after-free
	  testing, which is one of the more significant sources of overhead.
	  This option depends on <literal>options INVARIANT_SUPPORT</literal>.
	  </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options INVARIANT_SUPPORT</literal>: many of the tests
	  present in <literal>options INVARIANTS</literal> require modified
	  data structures or additional kernel symbols to be defined.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options WITNESS</literal>: this option enables run-time
	  lock order tracking and verification, and is an invaluable tool for
	  deadlock diagnosis.  WITNESS maintains a graph of acquired lock
	  orders by lock type, and checks the graph at each acquire for
	  cycles (implicit or explicit).  If a cycle is detected, a warning
	  and stack trace are generated to the console, indicating that a
	  potential deadlock might have occurred.  WITNESS is required in
	  order to use the <command>show locks</command>, <command>show
	  witness</command> and <command>show alllocks</command> DDB
	  commands.  This debug option has significant performance overhead,
	  which may be somewhat mitigated through the use of <literal>options
	  WITNESS_SKIPSPIN</literal>.  Detailed documentation may be found in
	  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>witness</refentrytitle><manvolnum>4</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options WITNESS_SKIPSPIN</literal>: disable run-time
	  checking of spinlock lock order with WITNESS.  As spin locks are
	  acquired most frequently in the scheduler, and scheduler events
	  occur often, this option can significantly speed up systems
	  running with WITNESS.  This option depends on <literal>options
	  WITNESS</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options WITNESS_KDB</literal>: change the default
	  value of the <literal>debug.witness.kdb</literal> sysctl to 1,
	  which causes WITNESS to enter the debugger when a lock order
	  violation is detected, rather than simply printing a warning.  This
	  option depends on <literal>options WITNESS</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options SOCKBUF_DEBUG</literal>: perform extensive
	  run-time consistency checking on socket buffers, which can be
	  useful for debugging both socket bugs and race conditions in
	  protocols and device drivers that interact with sockets.  This
	  option significantly impacts network performance, and may change
	  the timing in device driver races.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options DEBUG_VFS_LOCKS</literal>: track lock
	  acquisition points for lockmgr/vnode locks, expanding the amount
	  of information displayed by <command>show lockedvnods</command>
	  in DDB.  This option has a measurable performance impact.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options DEBUG_MEMGUARD</literal>: a replacement for
	  the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>malloc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>9</manvolnum></citerefentry> kernel memory allocator that uses the VM system
	  to detect reads or writes from allocated memory after free.
	  Details may be found in <citerefentry><refentrytitle>memguard</refentrytitle><manvolnum>9</manvolnum></citerefentry>.  This option has a
	  significant performance impact, but can be very helpful in
	  debugging kernel memory corruption bugs.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para><literal>options DIAGNOSTIC</literal>: enable additional, more
	  expensive diagnostic tests along the lines of <literal>options

<title>Synopsis</title>

<para>
Assembly language programming under <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> is highly undocumented. It
is generally assumed that no one would ever want to use it because
various <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> systems run on different microprocessors, so everything
should be written in C for portability.
</para>

<para>
In reality, C portability is quite a myth. Even C programs need
to be modified when ported from one <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> to another, regardless of
what processor each runs on. Typically, such a program is full
of conditional statements depending on the system it is
compiled for.
</para>

<para>
Even if we believe that all of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> software should be written in C,
or some other high-level language, we still need assembly language
programmers: Who else would write the section of C library
that accesses the kernel?
</para>

<para>
In this chapter I will attempt to show you
how you can use assembly language writing
<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> programs, specifically under FreeBSD.
</para>

<para>
This chapter does not explain the basics of assembly language.
There are enough resources about that (for a complete
online course in assembly language, see Randall Hyde's
<link xlink:href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/">Art
of Assembly Language</link>; or if you prefer
a printed book, take a look at Jeff Duntemann's
Assembly
Language Step-by-Step (ISBN: 0471375233). However,
once the chapter is finished, any assembly language programmer
will be able to write programs for FreeBSD
quickly and efficiently.

<sect2 xml:id="x86-the-assembler">
<title>The Assembler</title>

<para>
The most important tool for assembly language programming is the
assembler, the software that converts assembly language code
into machine language.
</para>

<para>
Two very different assemblers are available for FreeBSD. One is
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>as</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
which uses the traditional <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> assembly language syntax. It
comes with the system.
</para>

<para>
The other is <application>/usr/ports/devel/nasm</application>.
It uses the Intel syntax. Its main advantage is that it
can assemble code for many operating systems. It needs
to be installed separately, but is completely free.
</para>

<para>
This chapter uses <application>nasm</application>
syntax because most assembly language programmers
coming to FreeBSD from other operating systems
will find it easier to understand. And, because,
quite frankly, that is what I am used to.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-the-linker">
<title>The Linker</title>

<para>
The output of the assembler, like that of any
compiler, needs to be linked to form an executable file.
</para>

<para>
The standard
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>ld</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
linker comes with FreeBSD. It works with the
code assembled with either assembler.
</para>

<title>System Calls</title>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-default-calling-convention">
<title>Default Calling Convention</title>

<para>
By default, the FreeBSD kernel uses the C calling
convention. Further, although the kernel is accessed
using <function role="opcode">int 80h</function>,
it is assumed the program will call a function that
issues <function role="opcode">int 80h</function>, rather than
issuing <function role="opcode">int 80h</function> directly.
</para>

<para>
This convention is very convenient, and quite superior to the
<trademark class="registered">Microsoft</trademark> convention used by <acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym>.
Why? Because the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> convention allows any program written in
any language to access the kernel.
</para>

<para>
An assembly language program can do that as well.
For example, we could open a file:
</para>

<programlisting>
kernel:
	int	80h	; Call kernel
	ret

open:
	push	dword mode
	push	dword flags
	push	dword path
	mov	eax, 5
	call	kernel
	add	esp, byte 12
	ret
</programlisting>

<para>
This is a very clean and portable way of coding. If you need to
port the code to a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> system which uses a different interrupt,
or a different way of passing parameters, all you need to change
is the kernel procedure.
</para>

<para>
But assembly language programmers like to shave off cycles. The above example
requires a <function role="opcode">call/ret</function> combination.
We can eliminate it by
<function role="opcode">push</function>ing an extra dword:
</para>

<programlisting>
open:
	push	dword mode
	push	dword flags
	push	dword path
	mov	eax, 5
	push	eax		; Or any other dword
	int	80h
	add	esp, byte 16
</programlisting>

<para>
The <constant>5</constant> that we have placed in
<varname role="register">EAX</varname> identifies
the kernel function, in this case <function role="syscall">open</function>.
</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 xml:id="x86-alternate-calling-convention">
<title>Alternate Calling Convention</title>
<para>
FreeBSD is an extremely flexible system. It offers other ways of
calling the kernel. For it to work, however, the system must
have Linux emulation installed.
</para>

<para>
Linux is a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> like system. However, its kernel uses the same
system-call convention of passing parameters in registers
<acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym> does. As with the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> convention,
the function number is placed in <varname role="register">EAX</varname>.
The parameters, however, are not passed on the stack but in
<varname role="register">EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP</varname>:
</para>

<programlisting>
open:
	mov	eax, 5
	mov	ebx, path
	mov	ecx, flags
	mov	edx, mode
	int	80h
</programlisting>

<para>
This convention has a great disadvantage over
the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> way, at least as far as assembly language programming
is concerned: Every time you make a kernel call
you must <function role="opcode">push</function> the registers, then
<function role="opcode">pop</function> them later. This makes your code
bulkier and slower. Nevertheless, FreeBSD gives
you a choice.
</para>

<para>
If you do choose the Linux convention, you must let
the system know about it. After your program is assembled and
linked, you need to brand the executable:
</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>brandelf -t Linux <replaceable>filename</replaceable></userinput></screen>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-use-geneva">
<title>Which Convention Should You Use?</title>

<para>
If you are coding specifically for FreeBSD, you should always
use the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> convention: It is faster, you can store global
variables in registers, you do not have to brand
the executable, and you do not impose the installation of
the Linux emulation package on the target system.
</para>

<para>
If you want to create portable code that can also run
on Linux, you will probably still want to give the FreeBSD
users as efficient a code as possible. I will show you
how you can accomplish that after I have explained the basics.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-call-numbers">
<title>Call Numbers</title>

<para>
To tell the kernel which system service you are calling,
place its number in <varname role="register">EAX</varname>. Of course, you need
to know what the number is.
</para>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-the-syscalls-file">
<title>The <filename>syscalls</filename> File</title>

</para>

<para>
You can find the master file for the default <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> calling
convention in

If you need to use the other convention implemented
in the Linux emulation mode, read

<note>
<para>
Not only do FreeBSD and Linux use different calling
conventions, they sometimes use different numbers for
the same functions.
</para>

<informalexample>
<para>
For example, to <function>open</function> a file, we need
to <function role="opcode">push</function> the <varname>mode</varname> first,
then <varname>flags</varname>, then the address at which
the <varname>path</varname> is stored.

<sect1 xml:id="x86-return-values">
<title>Return Values</title>

<para>
A system call would not be useful most of the time
if it did not return some kind of a value: The file
descriptor of an open file, the number of bytes read
to a buffer, the system time, etc.
</para>

<para>
Additionally, the system needs to inform us if an error
occurs: A file does not exist, system resources are exhausted,
we passed an invalid parameter, etc.
</para>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-man-pages">
<title>Man Pages</title>

<para>
The traditional place to look for information about various
system calls under <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> systems are the manual pages.
FreeBSD describes its system calls in section 2, sometimes
in section 3.
</para>

<para>
For example, <citerefentry><refentrytitle>open</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry> says:
</para>

<blockquote>
<para>
If successful, <function>open()</function> returns a non-negative
integer, termed a file descriptor. It returns <varname>-1</varname> on failure,
and sets <varname>errno</varname> to indicate the error.
</para>

</blockquote>
<para>
The assembly language programmer new to <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> and FreeBSD will
immediately ask the puzzling question: Where is
<varname>errno</varname> and how do I get to it?
</para>

<note>
<para>
The information presented in the manual pages applies
to C programs. The assembly language programmer needs additional
information.

<sect2 xml:id="x86-where-return-values">
<title>Where Are the Return Values?</title>

<para>
Unfortunately, it depends... For most system calls it is
in <varname role="register">EAX</varname>, but not for all.
A good rule of thumb,
when working with a system call for
the first time, is to look for
the return value in <varname role="register">EAX</varname>.
If it is not there, you
need further research.
</para>

<note>
<para>
I am aware of one system call that returns the value in
<varname role="register">EDX</varname>: <function role="syscall">SYS_fork</function>. All others
I have worked with use <varname role="register">EAX</varname>.
But I have not worked with them all yet.
</para>

<tip>
<para>
If you cannot find the answer here or anywhere else,
study <application>libc</application> source code and see how it
interfaces with the kernel.
</para>
</tip>

</sect2>
<sect2 xml:id="x86-where-errno">
<title>Where Is <varname>errno</varname>?</title>

<para>
Actually, nowhere...
</para>

<para>
<varname>errno</varname> is part of the C language, not the
<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> kernel. When accessing kernel services directly, the
error code is returned in <varname role="register">EAX</varname>,
the same register the proper
return value generally ends up in.
</para>

<para>
This makes perfect sense. If there is no error, there is
no error code. If there is an error, there is no return
value. One register can contain either.
</para>

<para>
When using the standard FreeBSD calling convention,
the <varname role="register">carry flag</varname> is cleared upon success,
set upon failure.
</para>

<para>
When using the Linux emulation mode, the signed
value in <varname role="register">EAX</varname> is non-negative upon success,
and contains the return value. In case of an error, the value
is negative, i.e., <varname>-errno</varname>.

<sect1 xml:id="x86-portable-code">
<title>Creating Portable Code</title>

<para>
Portability is generally not one of the strengths of assembly language.
Yet, writing assembly language programs for different platforms is
possible, especially with <application>nasm</application>. I have written
assembly language libraries that can be assembled for such different
operating systems as <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark> and FreeBSD.
</para>

<para>
It is all the more possible when you want your code to run
on two platforms which, while different, are based on
similar architectures.
</para>

<para>
For example, FreeBSD is <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>, Linux is <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> like. I only
mentioned three differences between them (from an assembly language
programmer's perspective): The calling convention, the
function numbers, and the way of returning values.
</para>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-deal-with-function-numbers"><title>Dealing with Function Numbers</title>

<para>
In many cases the function numbers are the same. However,
even when they are not, the problem is easy to deal with:
Instead of using numbers in your code, use constants which
you have declared differently depending on the target
architecture:

<sect2 xml:id="x86-deal-with-geneva"><title>Dealing with Conventions</title>
<para>
Both, the calling convention, and the return value (the
<varname>errno</varname> problem) can be resolved with macros:
</para>

<programlisting>
%ifdef	LINUX

%macro	system	0
	call	kernel

kernel:
	push	ebx
	push	ecx

%endif
</programlisting>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-deal-with-other-portability"><title>Dealing with Other Portability Issues</title>

<para>
The above solutions can handle most cases of writing code
portable between FreeBSD and Linux. Nevertheless, with some
kernel services the differences are deeper.
</para>

<para>
In that case, you need to write two different handlers
for those particular system calls, and use conditional
assembly. Luckily, most of your code does something other
than calling the kernel, so usually you will only need
a few such conditional sections in your code.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-portable-library"><title>Using a Library</title>

<para>
You can avoid portability issues in your main code altogether
by writing a library of system calls. Create a separate library
for FreeBSD, a different one for Linux, and yet other libraries
for more operating systems.
</para>

<para>
In your library, write a separate function (or procedure, if
you prefer the traditional assembly language terminology) for each system
call. Use the C calling convention of passing parameters.
But still use <varname role="register">EAX</varname> to pass the call number in.
In that case, your FreeBSD library can be very simple, as
many seemingly different functions can be just labels to
the same code:
</para>

<programlisting>
sys.open:
sys.close:
[etc...]
	int	80h
	ret
</programlisting>

<para>
Your Linux library will require more different functions.
But even here you can group system calls using the same
number of parameters:
</para>

<programlisting>
sys.exit:
sys.close:
[etc... one-parameter functions]
	push	ebx
	mov	ebx, [esp+12]
	int	80h
	pop	ebx
	jmp	sys.return

...

sys.return:
	or	eax, eax
	js	sys.err
	clc
	ret

sys.err:
	neg	eax
	stc
	ret
</programlisting>

<para>
The library approach may seem inconvenient at first because
it requires you to produce a separate file your code depends
on. But it has many advantages: For one, you only need to
write it once and can use it for all your programs. You can
even let other assembly language programmers use it, or perhaps use
one written by someone else. But perhaps the greatest
advantage of the library is that your code can be ported
to other systems, even by other programmers, by simply
writing a new library without any changes to your code.
</para>

<para>
If you do not like the idea of having a library, you can
at least place all your system calls in a separate assembly language file
and link it with your main program. Here, again, all porters
have to do is create a new object file to link with your
main program.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-portable-include">
<title>Using an Include File</title>

<para>
If you are releasing your software as (or with)
source code, you can use macros and place them
in a separate file, which you include in your
code.
</para>

<para>
Porters of your software will simply write a new
include file. No library or external object file
is necessary, yet your code is portable without any
need to edit the code.
</para>

<note>
<para>
This is the approach we will use throughout this chapter.
We will name our include file <filename>system.inc</filename>, and
add to it whenever we deal with a new system call.
</para>
</note>

<para>
We can start our <filename>system.inc</filename> by declaring the
standard file descriptors:
</para>

<programlisting>
%define	stdin	0
%define	stdout	1
%define	stderr	2
</programlisting>

<para>
Next, we create a symbolic name for each system call:
</para>

<programlisting>
%define	SYS_nosys	0
%define	SYS_exit	1
%define	SYS_fork	2
%define	SYS_read	3
%define	SYS_write	4
; [etc...]
</programlisting>

<para>
We add a short, non-global procedure with a long name,
so we do not accidentally reuse the name in our code:
</para>

<programlisting>
section	.text
align 4
access.the.bsd.kernel:
	int	80h
	ret
</programlisting>

<para>
We create a macro which takes one argument, the syscall number:
</para>

<programlisting>
%macro	system	1
	mov	eax, %1
	call	access.the.bsd.kernel
%endmacro
</programlisting>

<para>
Finally, we create macros for each syscall. These macros take
no arguments.
</para>

<programlisting>
%macro	sys.exit	0
	system	SYS_exit
%endmacro

%macro	sys.fork	0
	system	SYS_fork

<para>
In the data section we create an array called <varname>hex</varname>.
It contains the 16 hexadecimal digits in ascending order.
The array is followed by a buffer which we will use for
both input and output. The first two bytes of the buffer
are initially set to <constant>0</constant>. This is where we will write
the two hexadecimal digits (the first byte also is
where we will read the input). The third byte is a
space.
</para>

<para>
The code section consists of four parts: Reading the byte,
converting it to a hexadecimal number, writing the result,
and eventually exiting the program.
</para>

<para>
To read the byte, we ask the system to read one byte
from <filename>stdin</filename>, and store it in the first byte
of the <varname>buffer</varname>. The system returns the number
of bytes read in <varname role="register">EAX</varname>. This will be <constant>1</constant>
while data is coming, or <constant>0</constant>, when no more input
data is available. Therefore, we check the value of
<varname role="register">EAX</varname>. If it is <constant>0</constant>,
we jump to <varname>.done</varname>, otherwise we continue.
</para>

<note>
<para>
For simplicity sake, we are ignoring the possibility
of an error condition at this time.

<para>
The hexadecimal conversion reads the byte from the
<varname>buffer</varname> into <varname role="register">EAX</varname>, or actually just
<varname role="register">AL</varname>, while clearing the remaining bits of
<varname role="register">EAX</varname> to zeros. We also copy the byte to
<varname role="register">EDX</varname> because we need to convert the upper
four bits (nibble) separately from the lower
four bits. We store the result in the first two
bytes of the buffer.
</para>

<para>
Next, we ask the system to write the three bytes
of the buffer, i.e., the two hexadecimal digits and
the blank space, to <filename>stdout</filename>. We then
jump back to the beginning of the program and
process the next byte.
</para>

<para>
Once there is no more input left, we ask the system
to exit our program, returning a zero, which is
the traditional value meaning the program was
successful.
</para>

<para>
Go ahead, and save the code in a file named <filename>hex.asm</filename>,

If you are migrating to <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> from <acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym>,
you may be wondering why each line ends with <constant>0A</constant>
instead of <constant>0D 0A</constant>.
This is because <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> does not use the cr/lf convention, but
a "new line" convention, which is <constant>0A</constant> in hexadecimal.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Can we improve this? Well, for one, it is a bit confusing because
once we have converted a line of text, our input no longer
starts at the beginning of the line. We can modify it to print
a new line instead of a space after each <constant>0A</constant>:

<para>
We have stored the space in the <varname role="register">CL</varname> register. We can
do this safely because, unlike <trademark class="registered">Microsoft</trademark> <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark>, <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> system
calls do not modify the value of any register they do not use
to return a value in.
</para>

<para>
That means we only need to set <varname role="register">CL</varname> once. We have, therefore,
added a new label <varname>.loop</varname> and jump to it for the next byte
instead of jumping at <varname>_start</varname>. We have also added the
<varname>.hex</varname> label so we can either have a blank space or a
new line as the third byte of the <varname>buffer</varname>.

That looks better. But this code is quite inefficient! We
are making a system call for every single byte twice (once

<sect1 xml:id="x86-buffered-io">
<title>Buffered Input and Output</title>

<para>
We can improve the efficiency of our code by buffering our
input and output. We create an input buffer and read a whole
sequence of bytes at one time. Then we fetch them one by one
from the buffer.
</para>

<para>
We also create an output buffer. We store our output in it until
it is full. At that time we ask the kernel to write the contents
of the buffer to <filename>stdout</filename>.
</para>

<para>
The program ends when there is no more input. But we still need
to ask the kernel to write the contents of our output buffer
to <filename>stdout</filename> one last time, otherwise some of our output
would make it to the output buffer, but never be sent out.
Do not forget that, or you will be wondering why some of your
output is missing.

<para>
We now have a third section in the source code, named
<varname>.bss</varname>. This section is not included in our
executable file, and, therefore, cannot be initialized. We use
<function role="opcode">resb</function> instead of <function role="opcode">db</function>.
It simply reserves the requested size of uninitialized memory
for our use.
</para>

<para>
We take advantage of the fact that the system does not modify the
registers: We use registers for what, otherwise, would have to be
global variables stored in the <varname>.data</varname> section. This is
also why the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> convention of passing parameters to system calls
on the stack is superior to the Microsoft convention of passing
them in the registers: We can keep the registers for our own use.
</para>

<para>
We use <varname role="register">EDI</varname> and <varname role="register">ESI</varname> as pointers to the next byte
to be read from or written to. We use <varname role="register">EBX</varname> and
<varname role="register">ECX</varname> to keep count of the number of bytes in the
two buffers, so we know when to dump the output to, or read more
input from, the system.

<para>
Not what you expected? The program did not print the output
until we pressed <userinput>^D</userinput>. That is easy to fix by
inserting three lines of code to write the output every time
we have converted a new line to <constant>0A</constant>. I have marked
the three lines with &gt; (do not copy the &gt; in your
<filename>hex.asm</filename>).

This approach to buffered input/output still
contains a hidden danger. I will discuss&#8212;and
fix&#8212;it later, when I talk about the
<link linkend="x86-buffered-dark-side">dark
side of buffering</link>.</para>
</note>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-ungetc">
<title>How to Unread a Character</title>

<warning><para>
This may be a somewhat advanced topic, mostly of interest to
programmers familiar with the theory of compilers. If you wish,
you may <link linkend="x86-command-line">skip to the next
section</link>, and perhaps read this later.
</para>
</warning>
<para>
While our sample program does not require it, more sophisticated
filters often need to look ahead. In other words, they may need
to see what the next character is (or even several characters).
If the next character is of a certain value, it is part of the
token currently being processed. Otherwise, it is not.
</para>

<para>
For example, you may be parsing the input stream for a textual
string (e.g., when implementing a language compiler): If a
character is followed by another character, or perhaps a digit,
it is part of the token you are processing. If it is followed by
white space, or some other value, then it is not part of the
current token.
</para>

<para>
This presents an interesting problem: How to return the next
character back to the input stream, so it can be read again
later?
</para>

<para>
One possible solution is to store it in a character variable,
then set a flag. We can modify <function>getchar</function> to check the flag,
and if it is set, fetch the byte from that variable instead of the
input buffer, and reset the flag. But, of course, that slows us
down.
</para>

<para>
The C language has an <function>ungetc()</function> function, just for that
purpose. Is there a quick way to implement it in our code?
I would like you to scroll back up and take a look at the
<function>getchar</function> procedure and see if you can find a nice and
fast solution before reading the next paragraph. Then come back
here and see my own solution.
</para>

<para>
The key to returning a character back to the stream is in how
we are getting the characters to start with:
</para>

<para>
First we check if the buffer is empty by testing the value
of <varname role="register">EBX</varname>. If it is zero, we call the
<function>read</function> procedure.
</para>

<para>
If we do have a character available, we use <function role="opcode">lodsb</function>, then
decrease the value of <varname role="register">EBX</varname>. The <function role="opcode">lodsb</function>
instruction is effectively identical to:
</para>

<programlisting>
	mov	al, [esi]
	inc	esi
</programlisting>

<para>
The byte we have fetched remains in the buffer until the next
time <function>read</function> is called. We do not know when that happens,
but we do know it will not happen until the next call to
<function>getchar</function>. Hence, to "return" the last-read byte back
to the stream, all we have to do is decrease the value of
<varname role="register">ESI</varname> and increase the value of <varname role="register">EBX</varname>:
</para>

<programlisting>
ungetc:
	dec	esi
	inc	ebx
	ret
</programlisting>

<para>
But, be careful! We are perfectly safe doing this if our look-ahead
is at most one character at a time. If we are examining more than
one upcoming character and call <function>ungetc</function> several times
in a row, it will work most of the time, but not all the time
(and will be tough to debug). Why?
</para>

<para>
Because as long as <function>getchar</function> does not have to call
<function>read</function>, all of the pre-read bytes are still in the buffer,
and our <function>ungetc</function> works without a glitch. But the moment
<function>getchar</function> calls <function>read</function>,
the contents of the buffer change.
</para>

<para>
We can always rely on <function>ungetc</function> working properly on the last
character we have read with <function>getchar</function>, but not on anything
we have read before that.
</para>

<para>
If your program reads more than one byte ahead, you have at least
two choices:
</para>

<para>
If possible, modify the program so it only reads one byte ahead.
This is the simplest solution.
</para>

<para>
If that option is not available, first of all determine the maximum
number of characters your program needs to return to the input
stream at one time. Increase that number slightly, just to be
sure, preferably to a multiple of 16&#8212;so it aligns nicely.
Then modify the <varname>.bss</varname> section of your code, and create
a small "spare" buffer right before your input buffer,
something like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
section	.bss
	resb	16	; or whatever the value you came up with
ibuffer	resb	BUFSIZE
obuffer	resb	BUFSIZE
</programlisting>

<para>
You also need to modify your <function>ungetc</function> to pass the value
of the byte to unget in <varname role="register">AL</varname>:
</para>

<programlisting>
ungetc:
	dec	esi
	inc	ebx
	mov	[esi], al
	ret
</programlisting>

<para>
With this modification, you can call <function>ungetc</function>
up to 17 times in a row safely (the first call will still
be within the buffer, the remaining 16 may be either within
the buffer or within the "spare").
</para>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 xml:id="x86-command-line"><title>Command Line Arguments</title>

<para>
Our <application>hex</application> program will be more useful if it can
read the names of an input and output file from its command
line, i.e., if it can process the command line arguments.
But... Where are they?
</para>

<para>
Before a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> system starts a program, it <function role="opcode">push</function>es some
data on the stack, then jumps at the <varname>_start</varname>
label of the program. Yes, I said jumps, not calls. That means the
data can be accessed by reading <varname>[esp+offset]</varname>,
or by simply <function role="opcode">pop</function>ping it.
</para>

<para>
The value at the top of the stack contains the number of
command line arguments. It is traditionally called
<varname>argc</varname>, for "argument count."
</para>

<para>
Command line arguments follow next, all <varname>argc</varname> of them.
These are typically referred to as <varname>argv</varname>, for
"argument value(s)." That is, we get <varname>argv[0]</varname>,
<varname>argv[1]</varname>, <varname>...</varname>,
<varname>argv[argc-1]</varname>. These are not the actual
arguments, but pointers to arguments, i.e., memory addresses of
the actual arguments. The arguments themselves are
NUL-terminated character strings.
</para>

<para>
The <varname>argv</varname> list is followed by a NULL pointer,
which is simply a <constant>0</constant>. There is more, but this is
enough for our purposes right now.
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you have come from the <acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym> programming
environment, the main difference is that each argument is in
a separate string. The second difference is that there is no
practical limit on how many arguments there can be.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Armed with this knowledge, we are almost ready for the next
version of <filename>hex.asm</filename>. First, however, we need to
add a few lines to <filename>system.inc</filename>:
</para>

<para>
First, we need to add two new entries to our list of system
call numbers:
</para>

<programlisting>
%define	SYS_open	5
%define	SYS_close	6
</programlisting>

<para>
Then we add two new macros at the end of the file:
</para>

<programlisting>
%macro	sys.open	0
	system	SYS_open
%endmacro

%macro	sys.close	0
	system	SYS_close
%endmacro
</programlisting>

<para>
In our <varname>.data</varname> section we now have two new variables,
<varname>fd.in</varname> and <varname>fd.out</varname>. We store the input and
output file descriptors here.
</para>

<para>
In the <varname>.text</varname> section we have replaced the references
to <varname>stdin</varname> and <varname>stdout</varname> with
<varname>[fd.in]</varname> and <varname>[fd.out]</varname>.
</para>

<para>
The <varname>.text</varname> section now starts with a simple error
handler, which does nothing but exit the program with a return
value of <constant>1</constant>.
The error handler is before <varname>_start</varname> so we are
within a short distance from where the errors occur.
</para>

<para>
Naturally, the program execution still begins at <varname>_start</varname>.
First, we remove <varname>argc</varname> and <varname>argv[0]</varname> from the
stack: They are of no interest to us (in this program, that is).
</para>

<para>
We pop <varname>argv[1]</varname> to <varname role="register">ECX</varname>. This
register is particularly suited for pointers, as we can handle
NULL pointers with <function role="opcode">jecxz</function>. If <varname>argv[1]</varname>
is not NULL, we try to open the file named in the first
argument. Otherwise, we continue the program as before: Reading
from <varname>stdin</varname>, writing to <varname>stdout</varname>.
If we fail to open the input file (e.g., it does not exist),
we jump to the error handler and quit.
</para>

<para>
If all went well, we now check for the second argument. If
it is there, we open the output file. Otherwise, we send
the output to <varname>stdout</varname>. If we fail to open the output
file (e.g., it exists and we do not have the write permission),
we, again, jump to the error handler.
</para>

<para>
The rest of the code is the same as before, except we close
the input and output files before exiting, and, as mentioned,
we use <varname>[fd.in]</varname> and <varname>[fd.out]</varname>.
</para>

<para>
Our executable is now a whopping 768 bytes long.
</para>

<para>
Can we still improve it? Of course! Every program can be improved.
Here are a few ideas of what we could do:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Have our error handler print a message to
<varname>stderr</varname>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Add error handlers to the <function>read</function>
and <function>write</function> functions.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Close <varname>stdin</varname> when we open an input file,
<varname>stdout</varname> when we open an output file.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Add command line switches, such as <parameter>-i</parameter>
and <parameter>-o</parameter>, so we can list the input and
output files in any order, or perhaps read from
<varname>stdin</varname> and write to a file.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Print a usage message if command line arguments are incorrect.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
I shall leave these enhancements as an exercise to the reader:
You already know everything you need to know to implement them.

<sect1 xml:id="x86-environment">
<title><trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> Environment</title>

<para>
An important <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> concept is the environment, which is defined by
<emphasis>environment variables</emphasis>. Some are set by the system, others
by you, yet others by the <application>shell</application>, or any program
that loads another program.
</para>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-find-environment">
<title>How to Find Environment Variables</title>

<para>
I said earlier that when a program starts executing, the stack
contains <varname>argc</varname> followed by the NULL-terminated
<varname>argv</varname> array, followed by something else. The
"something else" is the <emphasis>environment</emphasis>, or,
to be more precise, a NULL-terminated array of pointers to
<emphasis>environment variables</emphasis>. This is often referred
to as <varname>env</varname>.
</para>

<para>
The structure of <varname>env</varname> is the same as that of
<varname>argv</varname>, a list of memory addresses followed by a
NULL (<constant>0</constant>). In this case, there is no
<varname>"envc"</varname>&#8212;we figure out where the array ends
by searching for the final NULL.
</para>

<para>
The variables usually come in the <varname>name=value</varname>
format, but sometimes the <varname>=value</varname> part
may be missing. We need to account for that possibility.

the same way the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> <application>env</application> command does. But

<sect1 xml:id="x86-files">
<title>Working with Files</title>

<para>
We have already done some basic file work: We know how
to open and close them, how to read and write them using
buffers. But <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> offers much more functionality when it
comes to files. We will examine some of it in this section,
and end up with a nice file conversion utility.
</para>

<para>
Indeed, let us start at the end, that is, with the file
conversion utility. It always makes programming easier
when we know from the start what the end product is
supposed to do.
</para>

<para>
One of the first programs I wrote for <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> was
<link xlink:href="ftp://ftp.int80h.org/unix/tuc/"><application>tuc</application></link>,
a text-to-<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> file converter. It converts a text
file from other operating systems to a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> text file.
In other words, it changes from different kind of line endings
to the newline convention of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>. It saves the output
in a different file. Optionally, it converts a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> text
file to a <acronym>DOS</acronym> text file.
</para>

<para>
I have used <application>tuc</application> extensively, but always
only to convert from some other <acronym>OS</acronym>
to <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>, never the other way. I have always wished
it would just overwrite the file instead of me having
to send the output to a different file. Most of the time,
I end up using it like this:
</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>tuc <replaceable>myfile tempfile</replaceable></userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>mv <replaceable>tempfile myfile</replaceable></userinput></screen>

<para>
It would be nice to have a <application>ftuc</application>,
i.e., <emphasis>fast tuc</emphasis>, and use it like this:
</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>ftuc <replaceable>myfile</replaceable></userinput></screen>

<para>
In this chapter, then, we will write
<application>ftuc</application> in assembly language
(the original <application>tuc</application>
is in C), and study various
file-oriented kernel services in the process.
</para>

<para>
At first sight, such a file conversion is very
simple: All you have to do is strip the carriage
returns, right?
</para>

<para>
If you answered yes, think again: That approach will
work most of the time (at least with <acronym>MS
DOS</acronym> text files), but will fail occasionally.
</para>

<para>
The problem is that not all non <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> text files end their
line with the carriage return / line feed sequence. Some
use carriage returns without line feeds. Others combine several
blank lines into a single carriage return followed by several
line feeds. And so on.
</para>

<para>
A text file converter, then, must be able to handle
any possible line endings:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
carriage return / line feed
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
carriage return
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
line feed / carriage return
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
line feed
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
It should also handle files that use some kind of a
combination of the above (e.g., carriage return followed
by several line feeds).
</para>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-finite-state-machine">
<title>Finite State Machine</title>

<para>
The problem is easily solved by the use of a technique
called <emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis>, originally developed
by the designers of digital electronic circuits. A
<emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis> is a digital circuit
whose output is dependent not only on its input but on
its previous input, i.e., on its state. The microprocessor
is an example of a <emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis>: Our
assembly language code is assembled to machine language in which
some assembly language code produces a single byte
of machine language, while others produce several bytes.
As the microprocessor fetches the bytes from the memory
one by one, some of them simply change its state rather than
produce some output. When all the bytes of the op code are
fetched, the microprocessor produces some output, or changes
the value of a register, etc.
</para>

<para>
Because of that, all software is essentially a sequence of state
instructions for the microprocessor. Nevertheless, the concept
of <emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis> is useful in software design as well.
</para>

<para>
Our text file converter can be designed as a <emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis> with three
possible states. We could call them states 0-2,
but it will make our life easier if we give them symbolic names:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<symbol>ordinary
</symbol></para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<symbol>cr
</symbol></para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
<symbol>lf
</symbol></para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
Our program will start in the <symbol>ordinary</symbol>
state. During this state, the program action depends on
its input as follows:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
If the input is anything other than a carriage return
or line feed, the input is simply passed on to the output. The
state remains unchanged.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If the input is a carriage return, the state is changed
to <symbol>cr</symbol>. The input is then discarded, i.e.,
no output is made.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If the input is a line feed, the state is changed to
<symbol>lf</symbol>. The input is then discarded.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
Whenever we are in the <symbol>cr</symbol> state, it is
because the last input was a carriage return, which was
unprocessed. What our software does in this state again
depends on the current input:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
If the input is anything other than a carriage return
or line feed, output a line feed, then output the input, then
change the state to <symbol>ordinary</symbol>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If the input is a carriage return, we have received
two (or more) carriage returns in a row. We discard the
input, we output a line feed, and leave the state unchanged.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If the input is a line feed, we output the line feed
and change the state to <symbol>ordinary</symbol>. Note that
this is not the same as the first case above &#8211; if we tried
to combine them, we would be outputting two line feeds
instead of one.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
Finally, we are in the <symbol>lf</symbol> state after
we have received a line feed that was not preceded by a
carriage return. This will happen when our file already is
in <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> format, or whenever several lines in a row are
expressed by a single carriage return followed by several
line feeds, or when line ends with a line feed /
carriage return sequence. Here is how we need to handle
our input in this state:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
If the input is anything other than a carriage return or
line feed, we output a line feed, then output the input, then
change the state to <symbol>ordinary</symbol>. This is exactly
the same action as in the <symbol>cr</symbol> state upon
receiving the same kind of input.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If the input is a carriage return, we discard the input,
we output a line feed, then change the state to <symbol>ordinary</symbol>.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If the input is a line feed, we output the line feed,
and leave the state unchanged.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<sect3 xml:id="x86-final-state">
<title>The Final State</title>

<para>
The above <emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis> works for the entire file, but leaves
the possibility that the final line end will be ignored. That will
happen whenever the file ends with a single carriage return or
a single line feed. I did not think of it when I wrote
<application>tuc</application>, just to discover that
occasionally it strips the last line ending.
</para>

<para>
This problem is easily fixed by checking the state after the
entire file was processed. If the state is not
<symbol>ordinary</symbol>, we simply
need to output one last line feed.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Now that we have expressed our algorithm as a <emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis>,
we could easily design a dedicated digital electronic
circuit (a "chip") to do the conversion for us. Of course,
doing so would be considerably more expensive than writing
an assembly language program.
</para>
</note>

</sect3>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-tuc-counter">
<title>The Output Counter</title>

<para>
Because our file conversion program may be combining two
characters into one, we need to use an output counter. We
initialize it to <constant>0</constant>, and increase it
every time we send a character to the output. At the end of
the program, the counter will tell us what size we need
to set the file to.
</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-software-fsm">
<title>Implementing FSM in Software</title>

<para>
The hardest part of working with a <emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis>
is analyzing the problem and expressing it as a
<emphasis>finite state machine</emphasis>. That accomplished,
the software almost writes itself.
</para>

<para>
In a high-level language, such as C, there are several main
approaches. One is to use a <function role="statement">switch</function> statement
which chooses what function should be run. For example,
</para>

<programlisting>
	switch (state) {
	default:
	case REGULAR:
		regular(inputchar);
		break;
	case CR:
		cr(inputchar);
		break;
	case LF:
		lf(inputchar);
		break;
	}
</programlisting>

<para>
Another approach is by using an array of function pointers,
something like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
	(output[state])(inputchar);
</programlisting>

<para>
Yet another is to have <varname>state</varname> be a
function pointer, set to point at the appropriate function:
</para>

<programlisting>
	(*state)(inputchar);
</programlisting>
<para>
This is the approach we will use in our program because it is very easy to do in assembly language, and very fast, too. We will simply keep the address of the right procedure in <varname role="register">EBX</varname>, and then just issue:</para>

<programlisting>
	call	ebx
</programlisting>

<para>
This is possibly faster than hardcoding the address in the code
because the microprocessor does not have to fetch the address from
the memory&#8212;it is already stored in one of its registers. I said
<emphasis>possibly</emphasis> because with the caching modern
microprocessors do, either way may be equally fast.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="memory-mapped-files">
<title>Memory Mapped Files</title>

<para>
Because our program works on a single file, we cannot use the
approach that worked for us before, i.e., to read from an input
file and to write to an output file.
</para>

<para>
<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> allows us to map a file, or a section of a file,
into memory. To do that, we first need to open the file with the
appropriate read/write flags. Then we use the <function role="syscall">mmap</function>
system call to map it into the memory. One nice thing about
<function role="syscall">mmap</function> is that it automatically works with
virtual memory: We can map more of the file into the memory than
we have physical memory available, yet still access it through
regular memory op codes, such as <function role="opcode">mov</function>,
<function role="opcode">lods</function>, and <function role="opcode">stos</function>.
Whatever changes we make to the memory image of the file will be
written to the file by the system. We do not even have to keep
the file open: As long as it stays mapped, we can
read from it and write to it.
</para>

<para>
The 32-bit Intel microprocessors can access up to four
gigabytes of memory &#8211; physical or virtual. The FreeBSD system
allows us to use up to a half of it for file mapping.
</para>

<para>
For simplicity sake, in this tutorial we will only convert files
that can be mapped into the memory in their entirety. There are
probably not too many text files that exceed two gigabytes in size.
If our program encounters one, it will simply display a message
suggesting we use the original
<application>tuc</application> instead.
</para>

<para>
If you examine your copy of <filename>syscalls.master</filename>,
you will find two separate syscalls named <function role="syscall">mmap</function>.
This is because of evolution of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>: There was the traditional
<acronym>BSD</acronym> <function role="syscall">mmap</function>,
syscall 71. That one was superseded by the <acronym><trademark class="registered">POSIX</trademark></acronym> <function role="syscall">mmap</function>,
syscall 197. The FreeBSD system supports both because
older programs were written by using the original <acronym>BSD</acronym>
version. But new software uses the <acronym><trademark class="registered">POSIX</trademark></acronym> version,
which is what we will use.
</para>

<para>
The <filename>syscalls.master</filename> file lists
the <acronym><trademark class="registered">POSIX</trademark></acronym> version like this:
</para>

<programlisting>
197	STD	BSD	{ caddr_t mmap(caddr_t addr, size_t len, int prot, \
			    int flags, int fd, long pad, off_t pos); }
</programlisting>

<para>
This differs slightly from what
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>mmap</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
says. That is because
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>mmap</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
describes the C version.
</para>

<para>
The difference is in the <varname>long pad</varname> argument, which is not present in the C version. However, the FreeBSD syscalls add a 32-bit pad after <function role="opcode">push</function>ing a 64-bit argument. In this case, <varname>off_t</varname> is a 64-bit value.</para>

<para>
When we are finished working with a memory-mapped file,
we unmap it with the <function role="syscall">munmap</function> syscall:
</para>

<tip>
<para>
For an in-depth treatment of <function role="syscall">mmap</function>, see
W. Richard Stevens'
<link xlink:href="http://www.int80h.org/cgi-bin/isbn?isbn=0130810819">Unix
Network Programming, Volume 2, Chapter 12</link>.
</para>
</tip>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-file-size">
<title>Determining File Size</title>

<para>
Because we need to tell <function role="syscall">mmap</function> how many bytes
of the file to map into the memory, and because we want to map
the entire file, we need to determine the size of the file.
</para>

<para>
We can use the <function role="syscall">fstat</function> syscall to get all
the information about an open file that the system can give us.
That includes the file size.
</para>

<para>
Again, <filename>syscalls.master</filename> lists two versions
of <function role="syscall">fstat</function>, a traditional one
(syscall 62), and a <acronym><trademark class="registered">POSIX</trademark></acronym> one
(syscall 189). Naturally, we will use the
<acronym><trademark class="registered">POSIX</trademark></acronym> version:
</para>

<programlisting>
189	STD	POSIX	{ int fstat(int fd, struct stat *sb); }
</programlisting>

<para>
This is a very straightforward call: We pass to it the address
of a <varname remap="structname">stat</varname> structure and the descriptor
of an open file. It will fill out the contents of the
<varname remap="structname">stat</varname> structure.
</para>

<para>
I do, however, have to say that I tried to declare the
<varname remap="structname">stat</varname> structure in the
<varname>.bss</varname> section, and
<function role="syscall">fstat</function> did not like it: It set the carry
flag indicating an error. After I changed the code to allocate
the structure on the stack, everything was working fine.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-ftruncate">
<title>Changing the File Size</title>

<para>
Because our program may combine carriage return / line feed
sequences into straight line feeds, our output may be smaller
than our input. However, since we are placing our output into
the same file we read the input from, we may have to change the
size of the file.
</para>

<para>
The <function role="syscall">ftruncate</function> system call allows us to do
just that. Despite its somewhat misleading name, the
<function role="syscall">ftruncate</function> system call can be used to both
truncate the file (make it smaller) and to grow it.
</para>

<para>
And yes, we will find two versions of <function role="syscall">ftruncate</function>
in <filename>syscalls.master</filename>, an older one
(130), and a newer one (201). We will use
the newer one:
</para>

<programlisting>
201	STD	BSD	{ int ftruncate(int fd, int pad, off_t length); }
</programlisting>

<para>
Please note that this one contains a <varname>int pad</varname> again.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-ftuc">
<title>ftuc</title>

<para>
We now know everything we need to write <application>ftuc</application>.
We start by adding some new lines in <filename>system.inc</filename>.
First, we define some constants and structures, somewhere at
or near the beginning of the file:

</programlisting>

<programlisting>
%define	SYS_mmap	197
%define	SYS_munmap	73
%define	SYS_fstat	189
%define	SYS_ftruncate	201
</programlisting>

<para>
We add the macros for their use:
</para>

<programlisting>
%macro	sys.mmap	0
	system	SYS_mmap
%endmacro

%macro	sys.munmap	0

<warning><para>
Do not use this program on files stored on a disk formatted
by <acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym> or <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark>. There seems to be a
subtle bug in the FreeBSD code when using <function role="syscall">mmap</function>
on these drives mounted under FreeBSD: If the file is over
a certain size, <function role="syscall">mmap</function> will just fill the memory
with zeros, and then copy them to the file overwriting
its contents.
</para>

<sect1 xml:id="x86-one-pointed-mind">
<title>One-Pointed Mind</title>

<para>
As a student of Zen, I like the idea of a one-pointed mind:
Do one thing at a time, and do it well.
</para>

<para>
This, indeed, is very much how <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> works as well. While
a typical <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark> application is attempting to do everything
imaginable (and is, therefore, riddled with bugs), a
typical <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> program does only one thing, and it does it
well.
</para>

<para>
The typical <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> user then essentially assembles his own
applications by writing a shell script which combines the
various existing programs by piping the output of one
program to the input of another.
</para>

<para>
When writing your own <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> software, it is generally a
good idea to see what parts of the problem you need to
solve can be handled by existing programs, and only
write your own programs for that part of the problem
that you do not have an existing solution for.
</para>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-csv"><title>CSV</title>

<para>
I will illustrate this principle with a specific real-life
example I was faced with recently:
</para>

<para>
I needed to extract the 11th field of each record from a
database I downloaded from a web site. The database was a
<acronym>CSV</acronym> file, i.e., a list of
<emphasis>comma-separated values</emphasis>. That is quite
a standard format for sharing data among people who may be
using different database software.
</para>

<para>
The first line of the file contains the list of various fields
separated by commas. The rest of the file contains the data
listed line by line, with values separated by commas.
</para>

<para>
I tried <application>awk</application>, using the comma as a separator.
But because several lines contained a quoted comma,
<application>awk</application> was extracting the wrong field
from those lines.
</para>

<para>
Therefore, I needed to write my own software to extract the 11th
field from the <acronym>CSV</acronym> file. However, going with the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>
spirit, I only needed to write a simple filter that would do the
following:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Remove the first line from the file;
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Change all unquoted commas to a different character;
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Remove all quotation marks.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
Strictly speaking, I could use <application>sed</application> to remove
the first line from the file, but doing so in my own program
was very easy, so I decided to do it and reduce the size of
the pipeline.
</para>

<para>
At any rate, writing a program like this took me about
20 minutes. Writing a program that extracts the 11th field
from the <acronym>CSV</acronym> file would take a lot longer,
and I could not reuse it to extract some other field from some
other database.
</para>

<para>
This time I decided to let it do a little more work than
a typical tutorial program would:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
It parses its command line for options;
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
It displays proper usage if it finds wrong arguments;
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
It produces meaningful error messages.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
Here is its usage message:
</para>

<screen>Usage: csv [-t&lt;delim&gt;] [-c&lt;comma&gt;] [-p] [-o &lt;outfile&gt;] [-i &lt;infile&gt;]</screen>

<para>
All parameters are optional, and can appear in any order.
</para>

<para>
The <parameter>-t</parameter> parameter declares what to replace
the commas with. The <constant>tab</constant> is the default here.
For example, <parameter>-t;</parameter> will replace all unquoted
commas with semicolons.
</para>

<para>
I did not need the <parameter>-c</parameter> option, but it may
come in handy in the future. It lets me declare that I want a
character other than a comma replaced with something else.
For example, <parameter>-c@</parameter> will replace all at signs
(useful if you want to split a list of email addresses
to their user names and domains).
</para>

<para>
The <parameter>-p</parameter> option preserves the first line, i.e.,
it does not delete it. By default, we delete the first
line because in a <acronym>CSV</acronym> file it contains the field
names rather than data.
</para>

<para>
The <parameter>-i</parameter> and <parameter>-o</parameter>
options let me specify the input and the output files. Defaults
are <filename>stdin</filename> and <filename>stdout</filename>,
so this is a regular <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> filter.
</para>

<para>
I made sure that both <parameter>-i filename</parameter> and
<parameter>-ifilename</parameter> are accepted. I also made
sure that only one input and one output files may be
specified.
</para>

<para>
To get the 11th field of each record, I can now do:
</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>csv '-t;' <replaceable>data.csv</replaceable> | awk '-F;' '{print $11}'</userinput></screen>

<para>
The code stores the options (except for the file descriptors)
in <varname role="register">EDX</varname>: The comma in <varname role="register">DH</varname>, the new
separator in <varname role="register">DL</varname>, and the flag for
the <parameter>-p</parameter> option in the highest bit of
<varname role="register">EDX</varname>, so a check for its sign will give us a
quick decision what to do.
</para>

<para>
Here is the code:

<para>
Much of it is taken from <filename>hex.asm</filename> above. But there
is one important difference: I no longer call <function>write</function>
whenever I am outputting a line feed. Yet, the code can be
used interactively.
</para>

<para>
I have found a better solution for the interactive problem
since I first started writing this chapter. I wanted to
make sure each line is printed out separately only when needed.
After all, there is no need to flush out every line when used
non-interactively.
</para>

<para>
The new solution I use now is to call <function>write</function> every
time I find the input buffer empty. That way, when running in
the interactive mode, the program reads one line from the user's
keyboard, processes it, and sees its input buffer is empty. It
flushes its output and reads the next line.
</para>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-buffered-dark-side">
<title>The Dark Side of Buffering</title>
<para>
This change prevents a mysterious lockup
in a very specific case. I refer to it as the
<emphasis>dark side of buffering</emphasis>, mostly
because it presents a danger that is not
quite obvious.
</para>

<para>
It is unlikely to happen with a program like the
<application>csv</application> above, so let us consider yet
another filter: In this case we expect our input
to be raw data representing color values, such as
the <emphasis>red</emphasis>, <emphasis>green</emphasis>, and
<emphasis>blue</emphasis> intensities of a pixel. Our
output will be the negative of our input.
</para>

<para>
Such a filter would be very simple to write.
Most of it would look just like all the other
filters we have written so far, so I am only
going to show you its inner loop:
</para>

<programlisting>
.loop:
	call	getchar
	not	al		; Create a negative
	call	putchar
	jmp	short .loop
</programlisting>
<para>
Because this filter works with raw data,
it is unlikely to be used interactively.
</para>

<para>
But it could be called by image manipulation software.
And, unless it calls <function>write</function> before each call
to <function>read</function>, chances are it will lock up.
</para>

<para>
Here is what might happen:
</para>

<procedure><step><para>
The image editor will load our filter using the
C function <function>popen()</function>.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
It will read the first row of pixels from
a bitmap or pixmap.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
It will write the first row of pixels to
the <emphasis>pipe</emphasis> leading to
the <varname>fd.in</varname> of our filter.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
Our filter will read each pixel
from its input, turn it to a negative,
and write it to its output buffer.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
Our filter will call <function>getchar</function>
to fetch the next pixel.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
<function>getchar</function> will find an empty
input buffer, so it will call
<function>read</function>.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
<function>read</function> will call the
<function role="syscall">SYS_read</function> system call.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
The <emphasis>kernel</emphasis> will suspend
our filter until the image editor
sends more data to the pipe.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
The image editor will read from the
other pipe, connected to the
<varname>fd.out</varname> of our filter so it can set the first row of the
output image <emphasis>before</emphasis>
it sends us the second row of the input.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
The <emphasis>kernel</emphasis> suspends
the image editor until it receives
some output from our filter, so it
can pass it on to the image editor.
</para>
</step>
</procedure>
<para>
At this point our filter waits for the image
editor to send it more data to process, while
the image editor is waiting for our filter
to send it the result of the processing
of the first row. But the result sits in
our output buffer.
</para>

<para>
The filter and the image editor will continue
waiting for each other forever (or, at least,
until they are killed). Our software has just
entered a
<link linkend="secure-race-conditions">race condition</link>.
</para>

<para>
This problem does not exist if our filter flushes
its output buffer <emphasis>before</emphasis> asking the
<emphasis>kernel</emphasis> for more input data.

You can <function>push</function> a value on <acronym>TOS</acronym>
by using <function role="opcode">fld</function>, <function role="opcode">fild</function>,

To write meaningful software, we must not only
understand our programming tools, but also the
field we are creating software for.
</para>

<para>
Our next filter will help us whenever we want
to build a <emphasis>pinhole camera</emphasis>,
so, we need some background in <emphasis>pinhole
photography</emphasis> before we can continue.
</para>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-camera">
<title>The Camera</title>
<para>
The easiest way to describe any camera ever built
is as some empty space enclosed in some
lightproof material, with a small hole in the
enclosure.
</para>

<para>
The enclosure is usually sturdy (e.g., a box),
though sometimes it is flexible (the bellows).
It is quite dark inside the camera. However, the
hole lets light rays in through a single point
(though in some cases there may be several).
These light rays form an image, a representation
of whatever is outside the camera, in front of the
hole.
</para>

<para>
If some light sensitive material (such as film)
is placed inside the camera, it can capture the
image.</para>

<para>
The hole often contains a <emphasis>lens</emphasis>, or
a lens assembly, often called the <emphasis>objective</emphasis>.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-the-pinhole">
<title>The Pinhole</title>
<para>
But, strictly speaking, the lens is not necessary:
The original cameras did not use a lens but a
<emphasis>pinhole</emphasis>. Even today, <emphasis>pinholes</emphasis>
are used, both as a tool to study how cameras
work, and to achieve a special kind of image.
</para>

<para>
The image produced by the <emphasis>pinhole</emphasis>
is all equally sharp. Or <emphasis>blurred</emphasis>.
There is an ideal size for a pinhole: If it is
either larger or smaller, the image loses its
sharpness.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-focal-length">
<title>Focal Length</title>
<para>
This ideal pinhole diameter is a function
of the square root of <emphasis>focal
length</emphasis>, which is the distance of the
pinhole from the film.
</para>

<programlisting>
	D = PC * sqrt(FL)
</programlisting>
<para>
In here, <varname>D</varname> is the
ideal diameter of the pinhole,
<varname>FL</varname> is the focal length,
and <constant>PC</constant> is a pinhole
constant. According to Jay Bender,
its value is <constant>0.04</constant>, while
Kenneth Connors has determined it to
be <constant>0.037</constant>. Others have
proposed other values. Plus, this
value is for the daylight only: Other types
of light will require a different constant,
whose value can only be determined by
experimentation.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-f-number">
<title>The F&#8211;Number</title>
<para>
The f&#8211;number is a very useful measure of
how much light reaches the film. A light
meter can determine that, for example,
to expose a film of specific sensitivity
with f5.6 may require the exposure to last
1/1000 sec.</para>

<para>
It does not matter whether it is a 35&#8211;mm
camera, or a 6x9cm camera, etc.
As long as we know the f&#8211;number, we can determine
the proper exposure.
</para>

<para>
The f&#8211;number is easy to calculate:
</para>

<programlisting>
	F = FL / D
</programlisting>
<para>
In other words, the f&#8211;number equals the focal
length divided by the diameter of the pinhole.
It also means a higher f&#8211;number either implies
a smaller pinhole or a larger focal distance,
or both. That, in turn, implies, the higher
the f&#8211;number, the longer the exposure has to be.
</para>

<para>
Furthermore, while pinhole diameter and focal
distance are one&#8211;dimensional measurements,
both, the film and the pinhole, are two&#8211;dimensional.
That means that
if you have measured the exposure at f&#8211;number
<varname>A</varname> as <varname>t</varname>, then the exposure
at f&#8211;number <varname>B</varname> is:</para>

<programlisting>
	t * (B / A)²
</programlisting>
</sect3>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-normalized-f-number">
<title>Normalized F&#8211;Number</title>
<para>
While many modern cameras can change the diameter
of their pinhole, and thus their f&#8211;number, quite
smoothly and gradually, such was not always the case.
</para>

<para>
To allow for different f&#8211;numbers, cameras typically
contained a metal plate with several holes of
different sizes drilled to them.
</para>

<para>
Their sizes were chosen according to the above
formula in such a way that the resultant f&#8211;number
was one of standard f&#8211;numbers used on all cameras
everywhere. For example, a very old Kodak Duaflex IV
camera in my possession has three such holes for
f&#8211;numbers 8, 11, and 16.
</para>

<para>
A more recently made camera may offer f&#8211;numbers of
2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11,
16, 22, and 32 (as well as others).
These numbers were not chosen arbitrarily: They all are
powers of the square root of 2, though they may
be rounded somewhat.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-f-stop">
<title>The F&#8211;Stop</title>
<para>
A typical camera is designed in such a way that setting
any of the normalized f&#8211;numbers changes the feel of the
dial. It will naturally <emphasis>stop</emphasis> in that
position. Because of that, these positions of the dial
are called f&#8211;stops.</para>

<para>
Since the f&#8211;numbers at each stop are powers of the
square root of 2, moving the dial by 1
stop will double the amount of light required for
proper exposure. Moving it by 2 stops will
quadruple the required exposure. Moving the dial by
3 stops will require the increase in exposure
8 times, etc.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-pinhole-software">
<title>Designing the Pinhole Software</title>
<para>
We are now ready to decide what exactly we want our
pinhole software to do.
</para>

<sect3 xml:id="xpinhole-processing-input">
<title>Processing Program Input</title>
<para>
Since its main purpose is to help us design a working
pinhole camera, we will use the <emphasis>focal
length</emphasis> as the input to the program. This is something
we can determine without software: Proper focal length
is determined by the size of the film and by the need
to shoot "regular" pictures, wide angle pictures, or
telephoto pictures.
</para>

<para>
Most of the programs we have written so far worked with
individual characters, or bytes, as their input: The
<application>hex</application> program converted individual bytes
into a hexadecimal number, the <application>csv</application>
program either let a character through, or deleted it,
or changed it to a different character, etc.
</para>

<para>
One program, <application>ftuc</application> used the state machine
to consider at most two input bytes at a time.
</para>

<para>
But our <application>pinhole</application> program cannot just
work with individual characters, it has to deal with
larger syntactic units.
</para>

<para>
For example, if we want the program to calculate the
pinhole diameter (and other values we will discuss
later) at the focal lengths of <constant>100 mm</constant>,
<constant>150 mm</constant>, and <constant>210 mm</constant>, we may want
to enter something like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>100, 150, 210</userinput></screen>
<para>
Our program needs to consider more than a single byte of
input at a time. When it sees the first <constant>1</constant>,
it must understand it is seeing the first digit of a
decimal number. When it sees the <constant>0</constant> and
the other <constant>0</constant>, it must know it is seeing
more digits of the same number.
</para>

<para>
When it encounters the first comma, it must know it is
no longer receiving the digits of the first number.
It must be able to convert the digits of the first number
into the value of <constant>100</constant>. And the digits of the
second number into the value of <constant>150</constant>. And,
of course, the digits of the third number into the
numeric value of <constant>210</constant>.
</para>

<para>
We need to decide what delimiters to accept: Do the
input numbers have to be separated by a comma? If so,
how do we treat two numbers separated by something else?
</para>

<para>
Personally, I like to keep it simple. Something either
is a number, so I process it. Or it is not a number,
so I discard it. I do not like the computer complaining
about me typing in an extra character when it is
<emphasis>obvious</emphasis> that it is an extra character. Duh!
</para>

<para>
Plus, it allows me to break up the monotony of computing
and type in a query instead of just a number:
</para>

<screen><userinput>What is the best pinhole diameter for the focal length of 150?</userinput></screen>
<para>
There is no reason for the computer to spit out
a number of complaints:
</para>

<screen>Syntax error: What
Syntax error: is
Syntax error: the
Syntax error: best</screen>
<para>
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</para>

<para>
Secondly, I like the <constant>#</constant> character to denote
the start of a comment which extends to the end of the
line. This does not take too much effort to code, and
lets me treat input files for my software as executable
scripts.
</para>

<para>
In our case, we also need to decide what units the
input should come in: We choose <emphasis>millimeters</emphasis>
because that is how most photographers measure
the focus length.
</para>

<para>
Finally, we need to decide whether to allow the use
of the decimal point (in which case we must also
consider the fact that much of the world uses a
decimal <emphasis>comma</emphasis>).</para>

<para>
In our case allowing for the decimal point/comma
would offer a false sense of precision: There is
little if any noticeable difference between the
focus lengths of <constant>50</constant> and <constant>51</constant>,
so allowing the user to input something like
<constant>50.5</constant> is not a good idea. This is
my opinion, mind you, but I am the one writing
this program. You can make other choices in yours,
of course.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-pinhole-options">
<title>Offering Options</title>
<para>
The most important thing we need to know when building
a pinhole camera is the diameter of the pinhole. Since
we want to shoot sharp images, we will use the above
formula to calculate the pinhole diameter from focal length.
As experts are offering several different values for the
<constant>PC</constant> constant, we will need to have the choice.
</para>

<para>
It is traditional in <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> programming to have two main ways
of choosing program parameters, plus to have a default for
the time the user does not make a choice.
</para>

<para>
Why have two ways of choosing?</para>

<para>
One is to allow a (relatively) <emphasis>permanent</emphasis>
choice that applies automatically each time the
software is run without us having to tell it over and
over what we want it to do.
</para>

<para>
The permanent choices may be stored in a configuration
file, typically found in the user's home directory.
The file usually has the same name as the application
but is started with a dot. Often <emphasis>"rc"</emphasis>
is added to the file name. So, ours could be
<filename>~/.pinhole</filename> or <filename>~/.pinholerc</filename>.
(The <filename>~/</filename> means current user's
home directory.)
</para>

<para>
The configuration file is used mostly by programs
that have many configurable parameters. Those
that have only one (or a few) often use a different
method: They expect to find the parameter in an
<emphasis>environment variable</emphasis>. In our case,
we might look at an environment variable named
<varname>PINHOLE</varname>.
</para>

<para>
Usually, a program uses one or the other of the
above methods. Otherwise, if a configuration
file said one thing, but an environment variable
another, the program might get confused (or just
too complicated).
</para>

<para>
Because we only need to choose <emphasis>one</emphasis>
such parameter, we will go with the second method
and search the environment for a variable named
<varname>PINHOLE</varname>.</para>

<para>
The other way allows us to make <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis>
decisions: <emphasis>"Though I usually want
you to use 0.039, this time I want 0.03872."</emphasis>
In other words, it allows us to <emphasis>override</emphasis>
the permanent choice.
</para>

<para>
This type of choice is usually done with command
line parameters.
</para>

<para>
Finally, a program <emphasis>always</emphasis> needs a
<emphasis>default</emphasis>. The user may not make
any choices. Perhaps he does not know what
to choose. Perhaps he is "just browsing."
Preferably, the default will be the value
most users would choose anyway. That way
they do not need to choose. Or, rather, they
can choose the default without an additional
effort.
</para>

<para>
Given this system, the program may find conflicting
options, and handle them this way:
</para>

<procedure><step><para>
If it finds an <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> choice
(e.g., command line parameter), it should
accept that choice. It must ignore any permanent
choice and any default.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
<emphasis>Otherwise</emphasis>, if it finds
a permanent option (e.g., an environment
variable), it should accept it, and ignore
the default.</para>
</step>
<step><para>
<emphasis>Otherwise</emphasis>, it should use
the default.
</para>
</step>
</procedure>
<para>
We also need to decide what <emphasis>format</emphasis>
our <constant>PC</constant> option should have.
</para>

<para>
At first site, it seems obvious to use the
<varname>PINHOLE=0.04</varname> format for the
environment variable, and <parameter>-p0.04</parameter>
for the command line.
</para>

<para>
Allowing that is actually a security risk.
The <constant>PC</constant> constant is a very small
number. Naturally, we will test our software
using various small values of <constant>PC</constant>.
But what will happen if someone runs the program
choosing a huge value?
</para>

<para>
It may crash the program because we have not
designed it to handle huge numbers.
</para>

<para>
Or, we may spend more time on the program so
it can handle huge numbers. We might do that
if we were writing commercial software for
computer illiterate audience.
</para>

<para>
Or, we might say, <emphasis>"Tough!
The user should know better.""</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
Or, we just may make it impossible for the user
to enter a huge number. This is the approach we
will take: We will use an <emphasis>implied 0.</emphasis>
prefix.
</para>

<para>
In other words, if the user wants <constant>0.04</constant>,
we will expect him to type <parameter>-p04</parameter>,
or set <varname>PINHOLE=04</varname> in his environment.
So, if he says <parameter>-p9999999</parameter>, we will
interpret it as <constant>0.9999999</constant>&#8212;still
ridiculous but at least safer.
</para>

<para>
Secondly, many users will just want to go with either
Bender's constant or Connors' constant.
To make it easier on them, we will interpret
<parameter>-b</parameter> as identical to <parameter>-p04</parameter>,
and <parameter>-c</parameter> as identical to <parameter>-p037</parameter>.

</sect3>

<sect3 xml:id="x86-pinhole-output">
<title>The Output</title>
<para>
We need to decide what we want our software to
send to the output, and in what format.
</para>

<para>
Since our input allows for an unspecified number
of focal length entries, it makes sense to use
a traditional database&#8211;style output of showing
the result of the calculation for each
focal length on a separate line, while
separating all values on one line by a
<constant>tab</constant> character.
</para>

<para>
Optionally, we should also allow the user
to specify the use of the <acronym>CSV</acronym>
format we have studied earlier. In this case,
we will print out a line of comma&#8211;separated
names describing each field of every line,
then show our results as before, but substituting
a <constant>comma</constant> for the <constant>tab</constant>.</para>

<para>
We need a command line option for the <acronym>CSV</acronym>
format. We cannot use <parameter>-c</parameter> because
that already means <emphasis>use Connors' constant</emphasis>.
For some strange reason, many web sites refer to
<acronym>CSV</acronym> files as <emphasis>"Excel
spreadsheet"</emphasis> (though the <acronym>CSV</acronym>
format predates Excel). We will, therefore, use
the <parameter>-e</parameter> switch to inform our software
we want the output in the <acronym>CSV</acronym> format.
</para>

<para>
We will start each line of the output with the
focal length. This may sound repetitious at first,
especially in the interactive mode: The user
types in the focal length, and we are repeating it.
</para>

<para>
But the user can type several focal lengths on one
line. The input can also come in from a file or
from the output of another program. In that case
the user does not see the input at all.
</para>

<para>
By the same token, the output can go to a file
which we will want to examine later, or it could
go to the printer, or become the input of another
program.
</para>

<para>
So, it makes perfect sense to start each line with
the focal length as entered by the user.
</para>

<para>
No, wait! Not as entered by the user. What if the user
types in something like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>00000000150</userinput></screen>
<para>
Clearly, we need to strip those leading zeros.</para>

<para>
So, we might consider reading the user input as is,
converting it to binary inside the <acronym>FPU</acronym>,
and printing it out from there.
</para>

<para>
But...</para>

<para>
What if the user types something like this:
</para>

<screen><userinput>17459765723452353453534535353530530534563507309676764423</userinput></screen>
<para>
Ha! The packed decimal <acronym>FPU</acronym> format
lets us input 18&#8211;digit numbers. But the
user has entered more than 18 digits. How
do we handle that?
</para>

<para>
Well, we <emphasis>could</emphasis> modify our code to read
the first 18 digits, enter it to the <acronym>FPU</acronym>,
then read more, multiply what we already have on the
<acronym>TOS</acronym> by 10 raised to the number
of additional digits, then <function>add</function> to it.
</para>

<para>
Yes, we could do that. But in <emphasis>this</emphasis>
program it would be ridiculous (in a different one it may be just the thing to do): Even the circumference of the Earth expressed in
millimeters only takes 11 digits. Clearly,
we cannot build a camera that large (not yet,
anyway).
</para>

<para>
So, if the user enters such a huge number, he is
either bored, or testing us, or trying to break
into the system, or playing games&#8212;doing
anything but designing a pinhole camera.
</para>

<para>
What will we do?</para>

<para>
We will slap him in the face, in a manner of speaking:</para>

<screen>17459765723452353453534535353530530534563507309676764423	???	???	???	???	???</screen>
<para>
To achieve that, we will simply ignore any leading zeros.
Once we find a non&#8211;zero digit, we will initialize a
counter to <constant>0</constant> and start taking three steps:
</para>

<procedure>
<step><para>
Send the digit to the output.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
Append the digit to a buffer we will use later to
produce the packed decimal we can send to the
<acronym>FPU</acronym>.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
Increase the counter.
</para>
</step>
</procedure>
<para>
Now, while we are taking these three steps,
we also need to watch out for one of two
conditions:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
If the counter grows above 18,
we stop appending to the buffer. We
continue reading the digits and sending
them to the output.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If, or rather <emphasis>when</emphasis>,
the next input character is not
a digit, we are done inputting
for now.
</para>

<para>
Incidentally, we can simply
discard the non&#8211;digit, unless it
is a <constant>#</constant>, which we must
return to the input stream. It
starts a comment, so we must see it
after we are done producing output
and start looking for more input.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
That still leaves one possibility
uncovered: If all the user enters
is a zero (or several zeros), we
will never find a non&#8211;zero to
display.</para>

<para>
We can determine this has happened
whenever our counter stays at <constant>0</constant>.
In that case we need to send <constant>0</constant>
to the output, and perform another
"slap in the face":
</para>

<screen>0	???	???	???	???	???</screen>
<para>
Once we have displayed the focal
length and determined it is valid
(greater than <constant>0</constant>
but not exceeding 18 digits),
we can calculate the pinhole diameter.
</para>

<para>
It is not by coincidence that <emphasis>pinhole</emphasis>
contains the word <emphasis>pin</emphasis>. Indeed,
many a pinhole literally is a <emphasis>pin
hole</emphasis>, a hole carefully punched with the
tip of a pin.
</para>

<para>
That is because a typical pinhole is very
small. Our formula gets the result in
millimeters. We will multiply it by <constant>1000</constant>,
so we can output the result in <emphasis>microns</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
At this point we have yet another trap to face:
<emphasis>Too much precision.</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
Yes, the <acronym>FPU</acronym> was designed
for high precision mathematics. But we
are not dealing with high precision
mathematics. We are dealing with physics
(optics, specifically).
</para>

<para>
Suppose we want to convert a truck into
a pinhole camera (we would not be the
first ones to do that!). Suppose its box is
<constant>12</constant>
meters long, so we have the focal length
of <constant>12000</constant>. Well, using Bender's constant, it gives us square root of
<constant>12000</constant> multiplied by <constant>0.04</constant>,
which is <constant>4.381780460</constant> millimeters,
or <constant>4381.780460</constant> microns.
</para>

<para>
Put either way, the result is absurdly precise.
Our truck is not <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> <constant>12000</constant>
millimeters long. We did not measure its length
with such a precision, so stating we need a pinhole
with the diameter of <constant>4.381780460</constant>
millimeters is, well, deceiving. <constant>4.4</constant>
millimeters would do just fine.
</para>

<note>
<para>
I "only" used ten digits in the above example.
Imagine the absurdity of going for all 18!
</para>
</note>

<para>
We need to limit the number of significant
digits of our result. One way of doing it
is by using an integer representing microns.
So, our truck would need a pinhole with the diameter
of <constant>4382</constant> microns. Looking at that number, we still decide that <constant>4400</constant> microns,
or <constant>4.4</constant> millimeters is close enough.
</para>

<para>
Additionally, we can decide that no matter how
big a result we get, we only want to display four
significant digits (or any other number
of them, of course). Alas, the <acronym>FPU</acronym>
does not offer rounding to a specific number
of digits (after all, it does not view the
numbers as decimal but as binary).
</para>

<para>
We, therefore, must devise an algorithm to reduce
the number of significant digits.
</para>

<para>
Here is mine (I think it is awkward&#8212;if
you know a better one, <emphasis>please</emphasis>, let me know):</para>

<procedure>
<step><para>
Initialize a counter to <constant>0</constant>.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
While the number is greater than or equal to
<constant>10000</constant>, divide it by
<constant>10</constant> and increase the counter.
</para>
</step>
<step><para>
Output the result.</para>
</step>
<step><para>
While the counter is greater than <constant>0</constant>,
output <constant>0</constant> and decrease the counter.
</para>
</step>
</procedure>
<note>
<para>
The <constant>10000</constant> is only good if you want
<emphasis>four</emphasis> significant digits. For any other
number of significant digits, replace
<constant>10000</constant> with <constant>10</constant>
raised to the number of significant digits.
</para>
</note>

<para>
We will, then, output the pinhole diameter
in microns, rounded off to four significant
digits.
</para>

<para>
At this point, we know the <emphasis>focal
length</emphasis> and the <emphasis>pinhole
diameter</emphasis>. That means we have enough
information to also calculate the
<emphasis>f&#8211;number</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
We will display the f&#8211;number, rounded to
four significant digits. Chances are the
f&#8211;number will tell us very little. To make
it more meaningful, we can find the nearest
<emphasis>normalized f&#8211;number</emphasis>, i.e.,
the nearest power of the square root
of 2.
</para>

<para>
We do that by multiplying the actual f&#8211;number
by itself, which, of course, will give us
its <function>square</function>. We will then calculate
its base&#8211;2 logarithm, which is much
easier to do than calculating the
base&#8211;square&#8211;root&#8211;of&#8211;2 logarithm!
We will round the result to the nearest integer.
Next, we will raise 2 to the result. Actually,
the <acronym>FPU</acronym> gives us a good shortcut
to do that: We can use the <function role="opcode">fscale</function>
op code to "scale" 1, which is
analogous to <function role="opcode">shift</function>ing an
integer left. Finally, we calculate the square
root of it all, and we have the nearest
normalized f&#8211;number.
</para>

<para>
If all that sounds overwhelming&#8212;or too much
work, perhaps&#8212;it may become much clearer
if you see the code. It takes 9 op
codes altogether:</para>

<programlisting>
	fmul	st0, st0
	fld1
	fld	st1
	fyl2x
	frndint
	fld1
	fscale
	fsqrt
	fstp	st1
</programlisting>
<para>
The first line, <function role="opcode">fmul st0, st0</function>, squares
the contents of the <acronym>TOS</acronym>
(top of the stack, same as <varname role="register">st</varname>,
called <varname role="register">st0</varname> by <application>nasm</application>).
The <function role="opcode">fld1</function> pushes <constant>1</constant>
on the <acronym>TOS</acronym>.</para>

<para>
The next line, <function role="opcode">fld st1</function>, pushes
the square back to the <acronym>TOS</acronym>.
At this point the square is both in <varname role="register">st</varname>
and <varname role="register">st(2)</varname> (it will become
clear why we leave a second copy on the stack
in a moment). <varname role="register">st(1)</varname> contains
<constant>1</constant>.
</para>

<para>
Next, <function role="opcode">fyl2x</function> calculates base&#8211;2
logarithm of <varname role="register">st</varname> multiplied by
<varname role="register">st(1)</varname>. That is why we placed <constant>1</constant> on <varname role="register">st(1)</varname> before.</para>

<para>
At this point, <varname role="register">st</varname> contains
the logarithm we have just calculated,
<varname role="register">st(1)</varname> contains the square
of the actual f&#8211;number we saved for later.
</para>

<para>
<function role="opcode">frndint</function> rounds the <acronym>TOS</acronym>
to the nearest integer. <function role="opcode">fld1</function> pushes
a <constant>1</constant>. <function role="opcode">fscale</function> shifts the
<constant>1</constant> we have on the <acronym>TOS</acronym>
by the value in <varname role="register">st(1)</varname>,
effectively raising 2 to <varname role="register">st(1)</varname>.
</para>

<para>
Finally, <function role="opcode">fsqrt</function> calculates
the square root of the result, i.e.,
the nearest normalized f&#8211;number.
</para>

<para>
We now have the nearest normalized
f&#8211;number on the <acronym>TOS</acronym>,
the base&#8211;2 logarithm rounded to the
nearest integer in <varname role="register">st(1)</varname>,
and the square of the actual f&#8211;number
in <varname role="register">st(2)</varname>. We are saving
the value in <varname role="register">st(2)</varname> for later.
</para>

<para>
But we do not need the contents of
<varname role="register">st(1)</varname> anymore. The last
line, <function role="opcode">fstp st1</function>, places the
contents of <varname role="register">st</varname> to
<varname role="register">st(1)</varname>, and pops. As a
result, what was <varname role="register">st(1)</varname>
is now <varname role="register">st</varname>, what was <varname role="register">st(2)</varname>
is now <varname role="register">st(1)</varname>, etc.
The new <varname role="register">st</varname> contains the
normalized f&#8211;number. The new
<varname role="register">st(1)</varname> contains the square
of the actual f&#8211;number we have
stored there for posterity.
</para>

<para>
At this point, we are ready to output
the normalized f&#8211;number. Because it is
normalized, we will not round it off to
four significant digits, but will
send it out in its full precision.
</para>

<para>
The normalized f-number is useful as long
as it is reasonably small and can be found
on our light meter. Otherwise we need a
different method of determining proper
exposure.
</para>

<para>
Earlier we have figured out the formula
of calculating proper exposure at an arbitrary
f&#8211;number from that measured at a different
f&#8211;number.
</para>

<para>
Every light meter I have ever seen can determine
proper exposure at f5.6. We will, therefore,
calculate an <emphasis>"f5.6 multiplier,"</emphasis>
i.e., by how much we need to multiply the exposure measured
at f5.6 to determine the proper exposure
for our pinhole camera.
</para>

<para>
From the above formula we know this factor can be
calculated by dividing our f&#8211;number (the
actual one, not the normalized one) by
<constant>5.6</constant>, and squaring the result.
</para>

<para>
Mathematically, dividing the square of our
f&#8211;number by the square of <constant>5.6</constant>
will give us the same result.
</para>

<para>
Computationally, we do not want to square
two numbers when we can only square one.
So, the first solution seems better at first.
</para>

<para>
But...</para>

<para>
<constant>5.6</constant> is a <emphasis>constant</emphasis>.
We do not have to have our <acronym>FPU</acronym>
waste precious cycles. We can just tell it
to divide the square of the f&#8211;number by
whatever <constant>5.6²</constant> equals to.
Or we can divide the f&#8211;number by <constant>5.6</constant>,
and then square the result. The two ways
now seem equal.
</para>

<para>
But, they are not!</para>

<para>
Having studied the principles of photography
above, we remember that the <constant>5.6</constant>
is actually square root of 2 raised to
the fifth power. An <emphasis>irrational</emphasis>
number. The square of this number is
<emphasis>exactly</emphasis> <constant>32</constant>.
</para>

<para>
Not only is <constant>32</constant> an integer,
it is a power of 2. We do not need
to divide the square of the f&#8211;number by
<constant>32</constant>. We only need to use
<function role="opcode">fscale</function> to shift it right by
five positions. In the <acronym>FPU</acronym>
lingo it means we will <function role="opcode">fscale</function> it
with <varname role="register">st(1)</varname> equal to
<constant>-5</constant>. That is <emphasis>much
faster</emphasis> than a division.
</para>

<para>
So, now it has become clear why we have
saved the square of the f&#8211;number on the
top of the <acronym>FPU</acronym> stack.
The calculation of the f5.6 multiplier
is the easiest calculation of this
entire program! We will output it rounded
to four significant digits.
</para>

<para>
There is one more useful number we can calculate:
The number of stops our f&#8211;number is from f5.6.
This may help us if our f&#8211;number is just outside
the range of our light meter, but we have
a shutter which lets us set various speeds,
and this shutter uses stops.
</para>

<para>
Say, our f&#8211;number is 5 stops from
f5.6, and the light meter says
we should use 1/1000 sec.
Then we can set our shutter speed to 1/1000
first, then move the dial by 5 stops.
</para>

<para>
This calculation is quite easy as well. All
we have to do is to calculate the base-2
logarithm of the f5.6 multiplier
we had just calculated (though we need its
value from before we rounded it off). We then
output the result rounded to the nearest integer.
We do not need to worry about having more than
four significant digits in this one: The result
is most likely to have only one or two digits
anyway.</para>

</sect3>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-fpu-optimizations">
<title>FPU Optimizations</title>
<para>
In assembly language we can optimize the <acronym>FPU</acronym>
code in ways impossible in high languages,
including C.
</para>

<para>
Whenever a C function needs to calculate
a floating&#8211;point value, it loads all necessary
variables and constants into <acronym>FPU</acronym>
registers. It then does whatever calculation is
required to get the correct result. Good C
compilers can optimize that part of the code really
well.
</para>

<para>
It "returns" the value by leaving
the result on the <acronym>TOS</acronym>.
However, before it returns, it cleans up.
Any variables and constants it used in its
calculation are now gone from the <acronym>FPU</acronym>.
</para>

<para>
It cannot do what we just did above: We calculated
the square of the f&#8211;number and kept it on the
stack for later use by another function.
</para>

<para>
We <emphasis>knew</emphasis> we would need that value
later on. We also knew we had enough room on the
stack (which only has room for 8 numbers)
to store it there.
</para>

<para>
A C compiler has no way of knowing
that a value it has on the stack will be
required again in the very near future.
</para>

<para>
Of course, the C programmer may know it.
But the only recourse he has is to store the
value in a memory variable.
</para>

<para>
That means, for one, the value will be changed
from the 80-bit precision used internally
by the <acronym>FPU</acronym> to a C <emphasis>double</emphasis>
(64 bits) or even <emphasis>single</emphasis> (32
bits).
</para>

<para>
That also means that the value must be moved
from the <acronym>TOS</acronym> into the memory,
and then back again. Alas, of all <acronym>FPU</acronym>
operations, the ones that access the computer
memory are the slowest.
</para>

<para>
So, whenever programming the <acronym>FPU</acronym>
in assembly language, look for the ways of keeping
intermediate results on the <acronym>FPU</acronym>
stack.
</para>

<para>
We can take that idea even further! In our
program we are using a <emphasis>constant</emphasis>
(the one we named <constant>PC</constant>).
</para>

<para>
It does not matter how many pinhole diameters
we are calculating: 1, 10, 20,
1000, we are always using the same constant.
Therefore, we can optimize our program by keeping
the constant on the stack all the time.
</para>

<para>
Early on in our program, we are calculating the
value of the above constant. We need to divide
our input by <constant>10</constant> for every digit in the
constant.
</para>

<para>
It is much faster to multiply than to divide.
So, at the start of our program, we divide <constant>10</constant>
into <constant>1</constant> to obtain <constant>0.1</constant>, which we
then keep on the stack: Instead of dividing the
input by <constant>10</constant> for every digit,
we multiply it by <constant>0.1</constant>.
</para>

<para>
By the way, we do not input <constant>0.1</constant> directly,
even though we could. We have a reason for that:
While <constant>0.1</constant> can be expressed with just one
decimal place, we do not know how many <emphasis>binary</emphasis>
places it takes. We, therefore, let the <acronym>FPU</acronym>
calculate its binary value to its own high precision.
</para>

<para>
We are using other constants: We multiply the pinhole
diameter by <constant>1000</constant> to convert it from
millimeters to microns. We compare numbers to
<constant>10000</constant> when we are rounding them off to
four significant digits. So, we keep both, <constant>1000</constant>
and <constant>10000</constant>, on the stack. And, of course,
we reuse the <constant>0.1</constant> when rounding off numbers
to four digits.
</para>

<para>
Last but not least, we keep <constant>-5</constant> on the stack.
We need it to scale the square of the f&#8211;number,
instead of dividing it by <constant>32</constant>. It is not
by coincidence we load this constant last. That makes
it the top of the stack when only the constants
are on it. So, when the square of the f&#8211;number is
being scaled, the <constant>-5</constant> is at <varname role="register">st(1)</varname>,
precisely where <function role="opcode">fscale</function> expects it to be.
</para>

<para>
It is common to create certain constants from
scratch instead of loading them from the memory.
That is what we are doing with <constant>-5</constant>:
</para>

<programlisting>
	fld1			; TOS =  1
	fadd	st0, st0	; TOS =  2
	fadd	st0, st0	; TOS =  4
	fld1			; TOS =  1
	faddp	st1, st0	; TOS =  5
	fchs			; TOS = -5
</programlisting>
<para>
We can generalize all these optimizations into one rule:
<emphasis>Keep repeat values on the stack!</emphasis>
</para>

<tip>
<para>
<emphasis><trademark class="registered">PostScript</trademark></emphasis> is a stack&#8211;oriented
programming language. There are many more books
available about <trademark class="registered">PostScript</trademark> than about the
<acronym>FPU</acronym> assembly language: Mastering
<trademark class="registered">PostScript</trademark> will help you master the <acronym>FPU</acronym>.

</programlisting>
<para>
The code follows the same format as all the other
filters we have seen before, with one subtle
exception:
</para>

<blockquote>
<para>
We are no longer assuming that the end of input
implies the end of things to do, something we
took for granted in the <emphasis>character&#8211;oriented</emphasis>
filters.
</para>

<para>
This filter does not process characters. It
processes a <emphasis>language</emphasis>
(albeit a very simple
one, consisting only of numbers).
</para>

<para>
When we have no more input, it can mean one
of two things:</para>

<itemizedlist><listitem>
<para>
We are done and can quit. This is the
same as before.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
The last character we have read was a digit.
We have stored it at the end of our
<acronym>ASCII</acronym>&#8211;to&#8211;float conversion
buffer. We now need to convert
the contents of that buffer into a
number and write the last line of our
output.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>
<para>
For that reason, we have modified our <function>getchar</function>
and our <function>read</function> routines to return with
the <varname role="register">carry flag</varname> <emphasis>clear</emphasis> whenever we are
fetching another character from the input, or the
<varname role="register">carry flag</varname> <emphasis>set</emphasis> whenever there is no more
input.
</para>

<para>
Of course, we are still using assembly language magic
to do that! Take a good look at <function>getchar</function>.
It <emphasis>always</emphasis> returns with the
<varname role="register">carry flag</varname> <emphasis>clear</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Yet, our main code relies on the <varname role="register">carry
flag</varname> to tell it when to quit&#8212;and it works.
</para>

<para>
The magic is in <function>read</function>. Whenever it
receives more input from the system, it just
returns to <function>getchar</function>, which
fetches a character from the input buffer,
<emphasis>clears</emphasis> the <varname role="register">carry flag</varname>
and returns.
</para>

<para>
But when <function>read</function> receives no more
input from the system, it does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
return to <function>getchar</function> at all.
Instead, the <function role="opcode">add esp, byte 4</function>
op code adds <constant>4</constant> to <varname role="register">ESP</varname>,
<emphasis>sets</emphasis> the <varname role="register">carry
flag</varname>, and returns.
</para>

<para>
So, where does it return to? Whenever a
program uses the <function role="opcode">call</function> op code,
the microprocessor <function role="opcode">push</function>es the
return address, i.e., it stores it on
the top of the stack (not the <acronym>FPU</acronym>
stack, the system stack, which is in the memory).
When a program uses the <function role="opcode">ret</function>
op code, the microprocessor <function role="opcode">pop</function>s
the return value from the stack, and jumps
to the address that was stored there.
</para>

<para>
But since we added <constant>4</constant> to
<varname role="register">ESP</varname> (which is the stack
pointer register), we have effectively
given the microprocessor a minor case
of <emphasis>amnesia</emphasis>: It no longer
remembers it was <function>getchar</function>
that <function role="opcode">call</function>ed <function>read</function>.
</para>

<para>
And since <function>getchar</function> never
<function role="opcode">push</function>ed anything before
<function role="opcode">call</function>ing <function>read</function>,
the top of the stack now contains the
return address to whatever or whoever
<function role="opcode">call</function>ed <function>getchar</function>.
As far as that caller is concerned,
he <function role="opcode">call</function>ed <function>getchar</function>,
which <function role="opcode">ret</function>urned with the
<varname role="register">carry flag</varname> set!
</para>

</blockquote>
<para>
Other than that, the <function>bcdload</function>
routine is caught up in the middle of a
Lilliputian conflict between the Big&#8211;Endians
and the Little&#8211;Endians.
</para>

<para>
It is converting the text representation
of a number into that number: The text
is stored in the big&#8211;endian order, but
the <emphasis>packed decimal</emphasis> is little&#8211;endian.
</para>

<para>
To solve the conflict, we use the <function>std</function>
op code early on. We cancel it with <function>cld</function>
later on: It is quite important we do not
<function>call</function> anything that may depend on
the default setting of the <emphasis>direction
flag</emphasis> while <function>std</function> is active.
</para>

<para>
Everything else in this code should be quite
clear, providing you have read the entire chapter
that precedes it.
</para>

<para>
It is a classical example of the adage that
programming requires a lot of thought and only
a little coding. Once we have thought through every
tiny detail, the code almost writes itself.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-pinhole-using">
<title>Using <application>pinhole</application></title>
<para>
Because we have decided to make the program
<emphasis>ignore</emphasis> any input except for numbers
(and even those inside a comment), we can
actually perform <emphasis>textual queries</emphasis>.
We do not <emphasis>have to</emphasis>, but we <emphasis>can</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
In my humble opinion, forming a textual query,
instead of having to follow a very strict
syntax, makes software much more user friendly.
</para>

<para>
Suppose we want to build a pinhole camera to use the
4x5 inch film. The standard focal
length for that film is about 150mm. We want
to <emphasis>fine&#8211;tune</emphasis> our focal length so the
pinhole diameter is as round a number as possible.
Let us also suppose we are quite comfortable with
cameras but somewhat intimidated by computers.
Rather than just have to type in a bunch of numbers,
we want to <emphasis>ask</emphasis> a couple of questions.
</para>

<para>
Our session might look like this:</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>pinhole

Computer,

What size pinhole do I need for the focal length of 150?</userinput>
150	490	306	362	2930	12
<userinput>Hmmm... How about 160?</userinput>
160	506	316	362	3125	12
<userinput>Let's make it 155, please.</userinput>
155	498	311	362	3027	12
<userinput>Ah, let's try 157...</userinput>
157	501	313	362	3066	12
<userinput>156?</userinput>
156	500	312	362	3047	12
<userinput>That's it! Perfect! Thank you very much!
^D</userinput></screen>
<para>
We have found that while for the focal length
of 150, our pinhole diameter should be 490
microns, or 0.49 mm, if we go with the almost
identical focal length of 156 mm, we can
get away with a pinhole diameter of exactly
one half of a millimeter.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-pinhole-scripting">
<title>Scripting</title>
<para>
Because we have chosen the <constant>#</constant>
character to denote the start of a comment,
we can treat our <application>pinhole</application>
software as a <emphasis>scripting language</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
You have probably seen <application>shell</application>
<emphasis>scripts</emphasis> that start with:</para>

<programlisting>
#! /bin/sh
</programlisting>
<para>
...or...</para>

<programlisting>
#!/bin/sh
</programlisting> <para>
...because the blank space after the <function>#!</function>
is optional.
</para>

<para>
Whenever <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> is asked to run an executable
file which starts with the <function>#!</function>,
it assumes the file is a script. It adds the
command to the rest of the first line of the
script, and tries to execute that.
</para>

<para>
Suppose now that we have installed <application>pinhole</application>
in <application>/usr/local/bin/</application>, we can now
write a script to calculate various pinhole
diameters suitable for various focal lengths
commonly used with the 120 film.</para>

<para>
The script might look something like this:</para>

<programlisting>
#! /usr/local/bin/pinhole -b -i
# Find the best pinhole diameter
# for the 120 film

### Standard
80

### Wide angle
30, 40, 50, 60, 70

### Telephoto
100, 120, 140
</programlisting>
<para>
Because 120 is a medium size film,
we may name this file <application>medium</application>.
</para>

<para>
We can set its permissions to execute,
and run it as if it were a program:
</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>chmod 755 medium</userinput>
<prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>./medium</userinput></screen>
<para>
<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> will interpret that last command as:</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>/usr/local/bin/pinhole -b -i ./medium</userinput></screen>
<para>
It will run that command and display:
</para>

<screen>80	358	224	256	1562	11
30	219	137	128	586	9

<para>

Now, let us enter:</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>./medium -c</userinput></screen>
<para>
<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> will treat that as:</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>/usr/local/bin/pinhole -b -i ./medium -c</userinput></screen>
<para>
That gives it two conflicting options:
<parameter>-b</parameter> and <parameter>-c</parameter>
(Use Bender's constant and use Connors'
constant). We have programmed it so
later options override early ones&#8212;our
program will calculate everything

<title>Caveats</title>

<para>
Assembly language programmers who "grew up" under
<acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym> and <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark> often tend to take shortcuts.
Reading the keyboard scan codes and writing directly to video
memory are two classical examples of practices which, under
<acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym> are not frowned upon but considered the
right thing to do.
</para>

<para>
The reason? Both the <acronym>PC BIOS</acronym> and
<acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym> are notoriously
slow when performing these operations.
</para>

<para>
You may be tempted to continue similar practices in the
<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> environment. For example, I have seen a web site which
explains how to access the keyboard scan codes on a popular <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> clone.
</para>

<para>
That is generally a <emphasis>very bad idea</emphasis>
in <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> environment! Let me explain why.
</para>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-protected">
<title><trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> Is Protected</title>

<para>
For one thing, it may simply not be possible. <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> runs in
protected mode. Only the kernel and device drivers are allowed
to access hardware directly. Perhaps a particular <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> clone
will let you read the keyboard scan codes, but chances are a real
<trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> operating system will not. And even if one version may let you
do it, the next one may not, so your carefully crafted software may
become a dinosaur overnight.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 xml:id="x86-abstraction">
<title><trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> Is an Abstraction</title>

<para>
But there is a much more important reason not to try
accessing the hardware directly (unless, of course,
you are writing a device driver), even on the <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> like
systems that let you do it:
</para>

<para>
<emphasis><trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> is an abstraction!
</emphasis></para>

<para>
There is a major difference in the philosophy of design
between <acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym> and <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>.
<acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym> was designed as a single-user
system. It is run on a computer with a keyboard and a video
screen attached directly to that computer. User input is almost
guaranteed to come from that keyboard. Your program's output
virtually always ends up on that screen.
</para>

<para>
This is NEVER guaranteed under <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>. It is quite common
for a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> user to pipe and redirect program input and output:
</para>

<screen><prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>program1 | program2 | program3 &gt; file1</userinput></screen>

<para>
If you have written <application>program2</application>, your input
does not come from the keyboard but from the output of
<application>program1</application>. Similarly, your output does not
go to the screen but becomes the input for
<application>program3</application> whose output, in turn,
goes to <filename>file1</filename>.
</para>

<para>
But there is more! Even if you made sure that your input comes
from, and your output goes to, the terminal, there is no guarantee
the terminal is a PC: It may not have its video memory
where you expect it, nor may its keyboard be producing
<acronym>PC</acronym>-style scan codes. It may be a <trademark class="registered">Macintosh</trademark>,
or any other computer.
</para>

<para>
Now you may be shaking your head: My software is in
<acronym>PC</acronym> assembly language, how can
it run on a <trademark class="registered">Macintosh</trademark>? But I did not say your software
would be running on a <trademark class="registered">Macintosh</trademark>, only that its terminal
may be a <trademark class="registered">Macintosh</trademark>.
</para>

<para>
Under <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>, the terminal does not have to be directly
attached to the computer that runs your software, it can
even be on another continent, or, for that matter, on another
planet. It is perfectly possible that a <trademark class="registered">Macintosh</trademark> user in
Australia connects to a <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> system in North America (or
anywhere else) via <application>telnet</application>. The
software then runs on one computer, while the terminal is
on a different computer: If you try to read the scan codes,
you will get the wrong input!
</para>

<para>
Same holds true about any other hardware: A file you are reading
may be on a disk you have no direct access to. A camera you are
reading images from may be on a space shuttle, connected to you
via satellites.
</para>

<para>
That is why under <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> you must never make any assumptions about
where your data is coming from and going to. Always let the
system handle the physical access to the hardware.
</para>

<note>
<para>
These are caveats, not absolute rules. Exceptions are possible.
For example, if a text editor has determined it is running
on a local machine, it may want to read the scan codes
directly for improved control. I am not mentioning these caveats
to tell you what to do or what not to do, just to make you aware
of certain pitfalls that await you if you have just arrived to <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>
form <acronym><trademark class="registered">MS-DOS</trademark></acronym>. Of course, creative people often break
rules, and it is OK as long as they know they are breaking
them and why.

<para>
This tutorial would never have been possible without the
help of many experienced FreeBSD programmers from the
<link xlink:href="http://lists.FreeBSD.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-hackers">FreeBSD technical discussions mailing list</link>, many of whom have patiently
answered my questions, and pointed me in the right direction
in my attempts to explore the inner workings of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark>
system programming in general and FreeBSD in particular.
</para>

<para>
Thomas M. Sommers opened the door for me. His
<link xlink:href="http://www.codebreakers-journal.com/content/view/262/27/">How
do I write "Hello, world" in FreeBSD assembler?</link>
web page was my first encounter with an example of
assembly language programming under FreeBSD.
</para>

<para>
Jake Burkholder has kept the door open by willingly
answering all of my questions and supplying me with
example assembly language source code.
